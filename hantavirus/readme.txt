The code in this folder illustrates an iterative modeling process of PUUV Hantavirus in Sweden. The data is geospatial.
The oder of execution of files is as follows:

preprocess.R - takes in data and transforms it for use in the modeling process (not provided here)

model development.Rmd - The markdown file begins with some exploratory data analysis then iteratively builds an appropriate model.

modelScenario.R - Uses the developed model to make projections on a per climate scenario basis.

results.Rmd - Examine the projections and present them in a number of ways. Primarily as risk maps.
