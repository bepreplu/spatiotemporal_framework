  abstract = {The nearest neighbor decision rule assigns to an unclassified sample point the classification of the nearest of a set of previously classified points. This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of errorRof such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of errorR\^{}\{ast\}--the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in theM-category case thatR\^{}\{ast\} leq R leq R\^{}\{ast\}(2 --MR\^{}\{ast\}/(M-1)), where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.},

A novel aspect of our approach is that we treat noise as a separate class and model noise based on selected features. Trained Fisher classifiers are used to identify machine printed text and handwriting from noise and we further exploit context to refine the classification. A Markov Random Field-based (MRF) approach is used to model the geometrical structure of the printed text, handwriting, and noise to rectify misclassifications. Experimental results show that our approach is robust and can significantly improve page segmentation in noisy document collections.},

UAV propulsion system has different power requirements in order to complete its mission successfully. The different power stages in propulsion system introduce in flight taxing, take off, cruising and landing. The specific feature of the UAV is that power needed for the pay load which consists with sensors and communication devices is high compared with small manned aircraft. As the power sources, fuel cell has high energy density and battery has high power density which limited to short period. Fuel cells introduce challenges with dynamic load variations due to uncertain load requirements. These variations could cause the fuel cell to operate outside its optimum efficiency margin. In this paper, UAV Fuel Cell propulsion system is integrated with the battery source and controlled via a suitable Fuzzy Logic methodology also combined with an intelligent based approach for establishing the power converters duty-cycle modes of operation. Two power controllers are designed to adapt to the load variations and optimizes the fuel cell operation by utilizing the battery (Li-Ion) source in an effective manner. The intelligent based duty-cycle modes allows the power converters of fuel cell and battery to operate at the appropriate mode hence taking into account the systempsilas energy sources states of charge (SOC). Finally endurance of the Fuel cell powered hybrid UAV can improve significantly.},

Unification on a trie structure is suited to backtracking bindings of variables. The search and updating speed of an RBU prototype is measured to evaluate the indexing method. This method is effective for fast term retrieval for a large number of similar and varied form terms. The overhead for maintaining indexes in updating is low},

For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift.

Simply using guidelines from the DO-178B and the ARINC 653 standards does not guarantee that one will be able to have multiple applications running at different safety criticality levels. One needs to be able to merge applications written by different vendors, reuse applications from previous projects, and integrate different safety requirements while constructing a safety case for the overall IMA system. This, of course, must be done within a constrained budget that includes potential costs associated with changing program requirements. In order to achieve these goals, the design life cycle must be constructed in a way that allows for configuration and build partitioning of these applications, in parallel with the IMA platform itself and the overall systems integration. This investigates how the ARINC 653 standard can be used to provide this application and safety criticality level independence using guidelines from DO-178 and DO-297.

The (either online or offline) datasets of isolated characters contain about 3.9 million samples of 7,356 classes (7,185 Chinese characters and 171 symbols), and the datasets of handwritten texts contain about 5,090 pages and 1.35 million character samples. Each dataset is segmented and annotated at character level, and is partitioned into standard training and test subsets. The online and offline databases can be used for the research of various handwritten document analysis tasks.},

The intent is to provide convincing, valid, comprehensive assurance that a system is acceptably safe for a given application in a defined operating environment, by creating an argument structure that links claims about safety to a body of evidence. However, their construction is a largely manual, and therefore a time consuming, error prone, and expensive process. We present a methodology for automatically assembling safety cases which are auto-generated from the application of a formal method to software, with manually created safety cases derived from system safety analysis. Our approach emphasizes the heterogeneity of safety-relevant information, and we show how diverse content can be integrated into a single argument structure. To illustrate our methodology, we have applied it to the Swift Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) being developed at the NASA Ames Research Center. We present an end-to-end fragment of the resulting interim safety case comprising an aircraft-level argument manually constructed from the safety analysis of the Swift UAS, which is automatically assembled with an auto-generated lower-level argument produced from a formal proof of correctness of the safety-relevant properties of the software autopilot.},

In general, fuzzy systems optimized in such a way cannot provide a linguistic interpretation, preventing us from using one of their most interesting and useful features. This paper addresses this difficulty and points out a set of constraints that when used within an optimization scheme obviate the subjective task of interpreting membership functions. To achieve this a comprehensive set of semantic properties that membership functions should have is postulated and discussed. These properties are translated in terms of nonlinear constraints that are coded within a given optimization scheme, such as backpropagation. Implementation issues and one example illustrating the importance of the proposed constraints are included},

Its basic behavior is adapted by a region selection algorithm controlled by a region classification function, which scores the relevance of regions generated from the previous segmentation step. This approach results in a completely unseeded system. Its behavior, represented by a fuzzy rule system, is specialized for the present clinical applications by means of two different bioinspired approaches that minimize the segmentation error against a human expert asked to fulfill the same task. The first one is based on a real-valued genetic algorithm, whereas the second is based on an ant colony stigmergic algorithm. The two methodologies are tested and benchmarked on four data sets: 1) breast US images for carcinoma screening; 2) obs/gyn US for ovarian follicles assessment; and 3) two applications in anesthesiology US during brachial anesthesia. Results show that the proposed bioinspired approaches are well suited for these complex tasks and can be used as a straightforward methodology to adapt an image segmentation algorithm to fulfill recognition tasks. The system could be adapted to any application in US imaging that requires identification of anatomical districts, morphological structures, and any other region of interest related to the clinical practice.},

The traditional machine learning methods can no longer satisfy the exponential development of big data; there is a common assumption in these data-driving methods that the distribution of both the training data and testing data should be equivalent. A model built using today's data will not adequately address the classification tasks tomorrow if the distribution of the data item values has changed. Transfer learning is emerging as a solution to this issue, and many methods have been proposed. Few of the existing methods, however, explicitly indicate the solution to the case where the labels' distributions in two domains are different. This work proposes the fuzzy rule-based methods to deal with transfer learning problems where the discrepancy between the two domains shows in the label spaces. The presented methods are validated in both the synthetic and real-world datasets, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the introduced methods.},

  abstract = {The present article is a novel attempt in providing an exhaustive survey of neuro-fuzzy rule generation algorithms. Rule generation from artificial neural networks is gaining in popularity in recent times due to its capability of providing some insight to the user about the symbolic knowledge embedded within the network. Fuzzy sets are an aid in providing this information in a more human comprehensible or natural form, and can handle uncertainties at various levels. The neuro-fuzzy approach, symbiotically combining the merits of connectionist and fuzzy approaches, constitutes a key component of soft computing at this stage. To date, there has been no detailed and integrated categorization of the various neuro-fuzzy models used for rule generation. We propose to bring these together under a unified soft computing framework. Moreover, we include both rule extraction and rule refinement in the broader perspective of rule generation. Rules learned and generated for fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy control are also considered from this wider viewpoint. Models are grouped on the basis of their level of neuro-fuzzy synthesis. Use of other soft computing tools like genetic algorithms and rough sets are emphasized. Rule generation from fuzzy knowledge-based networks, which initially encode some crude domain knowledge, are found to result in more refined rules. Finally, real-life application to medical diagnosis is provided},

The salient characteristics of the GD-FNN are: (1) structure identification and parameters estimation are performed automatically and simultaneously without partitioning input space and selecting initial parameters a priori; (2) fuzzy rules can be recruited or deleted dynamically; (3) fuzzy rules can be generated quickly without resorting to the backpropagation (BP) iteration learning, a common approach adopted by many existing methods. The GD-FNN is employed in a wide range of applications ranging from static function approximation and nonlinear system identification to time-varying drug delivery system and multilink robot control. Simulation results demonstrate that a compact and high-performance fuzzy rule-base can be constructed. Comprehensive comparisons with other latest approaches show that the proposed approach is superior in terms of learning efficiency and performance},

However, no investigation has analyzed algorithms that use only specific instances to solve incremental learning tasks. In this paper, we describe a framework and methodology, called instance-based learning , that generates classification predictions using only specific instances. Instance-based learning algorithms do not maintain a set of abstractions derived from specific instances. This approach extends the nearest neighbor algorithm, which has large storage requirements. We describe how storage requirements can be significantly reduced with, at most, minor sacrifices in learning rate and classification accuracy. While the storage-reducing algorithm performs well on several real-world databases, its performance degrades rapidly with the level of attribute noise in training instances. Therefore, we extended it with a significance test to distinguish noisy instances. This extended algorithm's performance degrades gracefully with increasing noise levels and compares favorably with a noise-tolerant decision tree algorithm.},

The main cause of the landslides is torrential rain in short period of time. This area experiences several landslides each year, resulting in casualties, property damage, and economic loss. Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to produce the Landslide Susceptibility Maps for CMA so that appropriate landslide disaster risk reduction strategies can be developed. In this research, three different Geographic Information System-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis methods---the Artificial Hierarchy Process (AHP), Weighted Linear Combination (WLC), and Ordered Weighted Average (OWA)---were applied to scientifically assess the landslide susceptible areas in CMA. Nine different thematic layers or landslide causative factors were considered. Then, seven different landslide susceptible scenarios were generated based on the three weighted overlay techniques. Later, the performances of the methods were validated using the area under the relative operating characteristic curves. The accuracies of the landslide susceptibility maps produced by the AHP, WLC\_1, WLC\_2, WLC\_3, OWA\_1, OWA\_2, and OWA\_3 methods were found as 89.80, 83.90, 91.10, 88.50, 90.40, 95.10, and 87.10 \%, respectively. The verification results showed satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility maps produced and the existing data on the 20 historical landslide locations.},

  abstract = {In ecological systems, extremes can happen in time, such as population crashes, or in space, such as rapid range contractions. However, current methods for joint inference about temporal and spatial dynamics (e.g., spatiotemporal modeling with Gaussian random fields) may perform poorly when underlying processes include extreme events. Here we introduce a model that allows for extremes to occur simultaneously in time and space. Our model is a Bayesian predictive-process GLMM (generalized linear mixed-effects model) that uses a multivariate-t distribution to describe spatial random effects. The approach is easily implemented with our flexible R package glmmfields. First, using simulated data, we demonstrate the ability to recapture spatiotemporal extremes, and explore the consequences of fitting models that ignore such extremes. Second, we predict tree mortality from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks in the U.S. Pacific Northwest over the last 16 yr. We show that our approach provides more accurate and precise predictions compared to traditional spatiotemporal models when extremes are present. Our R package makes these models accessible to a wide range of ecologists and scientists in other disciplines interested in fitting spatiotemporal GLMMs, with and without extremes.},

The chikungunya virus, a Togaviridae member of the genusAlphavirus, reached the Americas in 2013 and, the following year, more than a million cases were reported. In Brazil, indigenous transmission was registered in Amapa and Bahia States, even during the period of low rainfall, exposing the whole country to the risk of virus spreading. Brazil is historically infested by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, also dengue vectors. Chikungunya may spread, and it is important to take measures to prevent the virus from becoming endemic in the country. Adequate care for patients with chikungunya fever requires training general practitioners, rheumatologists, nurses, and experts in laboratory diagnosis. Up to November 2014, more than 1,000 cases of the virus were reported in Brazil. There is a need for experimental studies in animal models to understand the dynamics of infection and the pathogenesis as well as to identify pathophysiological mechanisms that may contribute to identifying effective drugs against the virus. Clinical trials are needed to identify the causal relationship between the virus and serious injuries observed in different organs and joints. In the absence of vaccines or effective drugs against the virus, currently the only way to prevent the disease is vector control, which will also reduce the number of cases of dengue fever.},

The main new contribution of this paper is the treatment of description logics with existential restrictions.

The lcs operation then corresponds to the product operation on trees.},

  abstract = {Coming up with Bayesian models for spatial data is easy, but performing inference with them can be challenging. Writing fast inference code for a complex spatial model with realistically-sized datasets from scratch is time-consuming, and if changes are made to the model, there is little guarantee that the code performs well. The key advantages of R-INLA are the ease with which complex models can be created and modified, without the need to write complex code, and the speed at which inference can be done even for spatial problems with hundreds of thousands of observations. R-INLA handles latent Gaussian models, where fixed effects, structured and unstructured Gaussian random effects are combined linearly in a linear predictor, and the elements of the linear predictor are observed through one or more likelihoods. The structured random effects can be both standard areal model such as the Besag and the BYM models, and geostatistical models from a subset of the Mat{\'e}rn Gaussian random fields. In this review, we discuss the large success of spatial modeling with R-INLA and the types of spatial models that can be fitted, we give an overview of recent developments for areal models, and we give an overview of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach and some of the ways it can be extended beyond the assumptions of isotropy and separability. In particular, we describe how slight changes to the SPDE approach leads to straight-forward approaches for nonstationary spatial models and nonseparable space--time models.

Optimal vaccine allocations attempt to leave the same number of susceptibles in every household if the disease has a very high transmission rate within households. This means that proportionately more individuals need to be vaccinated in larger households if the vaccine efficacy is {$<$} 100\%. The linear programming formulation can accommodate heterogeneity among individuals of the proportionate mixing form and can also minimize the initial reproduction number for a given achievable vaccination coverage.},

Perhaps the most straightforward task is that of image restoration, though it is often suggested that this is an area of relatively minor practical importance. The present paper argues the contrary, since many problems in the analysis of spatial data can be interpreted as problems of image restoration. Furthermore, the amounts of data involved allow routine use of computer intensive methods, such as the Gibbs sampler, that are not yet practicable for conventional images. Two examples are given, one in archeology, the other in epidemiology. These are preceded by a partial review of pixel-based Bayesian image analysis.},

  abstract = {Introduction:~           Snakebite is a public health problem in rural areas of South Asia, Africa and South America presenting mostly in primary care. Climate change and associated extreme weather events are expected to modify the snake-human-environment interface leading to a change in the burden of snakebite. Understanding this change is essential to ensure the preparedness of primary care and public health systems.           Methods:~           We searched five electronic databases and supplemented them with other methods to identify eight studies on the effect of climate change on the burden of snakebite. We summarised the results thematically.           Results:~           Available evidence is limited but estimates a geographic shift in risk of snakebite: northwards in North America and southwards in South America and in Mozambique. One study from Sri Lanka estimated a 31.3\% increase in the incidence of snakebite. Based on limited evidence, the incidence of snakebite was not associated with tropical storms/hurricanes and droughts in the United States but associated with heatwaves in Israel.           Conclusion:~           The impact of climate change and associated extreme weather events and anthropogenic changes on mortality, morbidity and socioeconomic burden of snakebite. Transdisciplinary approaches can help understand these complex phenomena better. There is almost no evidence available in high-burden nations of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Community-based approaches for biodiversity and prevention, the institution of longitudinal studies, together with improving the resilience of primary care and public health systems are required to mitigate the impact of climate change on snakebite.},

  abstract = {An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and the number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and the uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the initial number of exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods, and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order for the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constrain the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, with a reproduction ratio R0 of 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22, and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15,600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit to the dead individuals is 4.25 days, and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57\%, and it is 2.37\% if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initial number of exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47\%. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 vs. 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 vs. 0.57\%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit to the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to knowledge of the precise bounds of the parameters. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing, and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, it is important to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.},

In urban slums, leptospirosis is associated with deficient sanitary infrastructure. Yet, the role of sewerage in the reduction of the environmental contamination with pathogenicLeptospirahas not been explored. Here, we conducted a survey of the pathogen in soils surrounding open and closed sewer sections in six urban slums in Brazil. We found that soils surrounding conventionally closed sewers (governmental interventions) were 3 times less likely to contain pathogenicLeptospira(inverse OR 3.44, 95\% CI = 1.66-8.33;p{$<$} 0.001) and contained a 6 times lower load of the pathogen (0.82 log10units difference,p{$<$} 0.01) when compared to their open counterparts. However, no differences were observed in community-closed sewers (poor-quality closings performed by the slum dwellers). Human fecal markers (BacHum) were positively associated with pathogenicLeptospiraeven in closed sewers, and rat presence was not predictive of the presence of the pathogen in soils, suggesting that site-specific rodent control may not be sufficient to reduce the environmental contamination withLeptospira. Overall, our results indicate that sewerage expansion to urban slums may help reduce the environmental contamination with the pathogen and therefore reduce the risk of human leptospirosis.},

The ectothermic nature of snakes raises the issue of how climate change's impact on snake ecology could influence the incidence of snakebites in humans in ways that echo the increased predation pressure of snakes on their prey. We thus ask whether snakebites reported in Costa Rica from 2005 to 2013 were associated with meteorological fluctuations. We emphasize El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a climatic phenomenon associated with cycles of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in the region and elsewhere. We ask how spatial heterogeneity in snakebites and poverty are associated, given the importance of the latter for NTDs. We found that periodicity in snakebites reflects snake reproductive phenology and is associated with ENSO. Snakebites are more likely to occur at high temperatures and may be significantly reduced after the rainy season. Nevertheless, snakebites cluster in Costa Rican areas with the heaviest rainfall, increase with poverty indicators, and decrease with altitude. Altogether, our results suggest that snakebites might vary as a result of climate change.},

These techniques also enable the systematic comparison of competing model classes. The processes of calibration and comparison constitute the building blocks of a larger validation process, the goal of which is to accept or reject a given mathematical model for the prediction of a particular QoI for a particular scenario. In this work, we take the first step in this process by applying the methodology to the analysis of the Spalart--Allmaras turbulence model in the context of incompressible, boundary layer flows. Three competing model classes based on the Spalart--Allmaras model are formulated, calibrated against experimental data, and used to issue a prediction with quantified uncertainty. The model classes are compared in terms of their posterior probabilities and their prediction of QoI's. The model posterior probability represents the relative plausibility of a model class given the data. Thus, it incorporates the model's ability to fit experimental observations. Alternatively, comparing models using the predicted QoI connects the process to the needs of decision makers that use the results of the model. We show that by using both the model plausibility and predicted QoI, one has the opportunity to reject some model classes after calibration, before subjecting the remaining classes to additional validation challenges.},

In the Americas, yellow fever in humans primarily occurs following spillover from non-human primates via mosquitoes. Predicting yellow fever spillover can improve public health responses through vector control and mass vaccination. Here, we develop and test a mechanistic model of pathogen spillover to predict human risk for yellow fever in Brazil. This environmental risk model, based on the ecology of mosquito vectors and non-human primate hosts, distinguished municipality-months with yellow fever spillover from 2001 to 2016 with high accuracy (AUC = 0.72). Incorporating hypothesized cyclical dynamics of infected primates improved accuracy (AUC = 0.79). Using boosted regression trees to identify gaps in the mechanistic model, we found that important predictors include current and one-month lagged environmental risk, vaccine coverage, population density, temperature and precipitation. More broadly, we show that for a widespread human viral pathogen, the ecological interactions between environment, vectors, reservoir hosts and humans can predict spillover with surprising accuracy, suggesting the potential to improve preventive action to reduce yellow fever spillover and avert onward epidemics in humans.

Few studies have identified markers for rat infestation in slum environments while none have evaluated the association between household rat infestation and Leptospira infection in humans or the use of infestation markers as a predictive model to stratify risk for leptospirosis. We enrolled a cohort of 2,003 urban slum residents from Salvador, Brazil in 2004, and followed the cohort during four annual serosurveys to identify serologic evidence for Leptospira infection. In 2007, we performed rodent infestation and environmental surveys of 80 case households, in which resided at least one individual with Leptospira infection, and 109 control households. In the case-control study, signs of rodent infestation were identified in 78\% and 42\% of the households, respectively. Regression modeling identified the presence of R. norvegicus feces (OR, 4.95; 95\% CI, 2.13--11.47), rodent burrows (2.80; 1.06--7.36), access to water (2.79; 1.28--6.09), and un-plastered walls (2.71; 1.21--6.04) as independent risk factors associated with Leptospira infection in a household. We developed a predictive model for infection, based on assigning scores to each of the rodent infestation risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found that the prediction score produced a good/excellent fit based on an area under the curve of 0.78 (0.71--0.84). Our study found that a high proportion of slum households were infested with R. norvegicus and that rat infestation was significantly associated with the risk of Leptospira infection, indicating that high level transmission occurs among slum households. We developed an easily applicable prediction score based on rat infestation markers, which identified households with highest infection risk. The use of the prediction score in community-based screening may therefore be an effective risk stratification strategy for targeting control measures in slum settings of high leptospirosis transmission.},

Methodology/Principal Findings Our study, conducted in Salvador, Brazil, established the average load of leptospires in positive kidneys to be 5.9 x 106) per mL (range 3.1-8.2 x106) genome equivalents (GEq), similar to the 6.1 x 106) per ml (range 2.2-9.4 x106)) average obtained from paired urines, with a significant positive correlation (R2=0.78) between the two. Based on bivariate and multivariate modeling, we found with both kidney and urine samples that leptospiral loads increased with the age of rats (based on the index of body length to mass), MAT titer and the presence of wounding/scars, and varied with site of capture. Some associations were modified by sex but trends were apparent. Combining with data on the demographic properties and prevalence of leptospiral carriage in rat populations in Salvador, we estimated that daily leptospiral loads shed in the urine of a population of 82 individuals exceeded 9.1 x 1010 leptospires. Conclusions/Significance These factors directly influence the risk of leptospiral acquisition among humans and provide essential epidemiological information linking properties of rat populations with risk of human infection.},

  abstract = {For pathogens known to transmit across host species, strategic investment in disease control requires knowledge about where and when spillover transmission is likely. One approach to estimating spillover is to directly correlate observed spillover events with covariates. An alternative is to mechanistically combine information on host density, distribution and pathogen prevalence to predict where and when spillover events are expected to occur. We use several case studies at the wildlife--livestock disease interface to highlight the challenges, and potential solutions, to estimating spatiotemporal variation in spillover risk. Datasets on multiple host species often do not align in space, time or resolution, and may have no estimates of observation error. Linking these datasets requires they be related to a common spatial and temporal resolution and appropriately propagating errors in predictions can be difficult. Hierarchical models are one potential solution, but for fine-resolution predictions at broad spatial scales, many models become computationally challenging. Despite these limitations, the confrontation of mechanistic predictions with observed events is an important avenue for developing a better understanding of pathogen spillover. Systems where data have been collected at all levels in the spillover process are rare, or non-existent, and require investment and sustained effort across disciplines. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.},

Quarantine strategies play the key role on the disease controlling and public health in the world with this pandemic of the COVID-19 defined by the World Health Organization. Methods In this study, a SEIRQ epidemic model was developed to explore the dynamic changes of COVID-19 in Wuhan and mainland China, from January 27, 2020 to March 5, 2020. Moreover, to investigate the effects of the quarantine strategies, two perspectives are employed from the different quarantine magnitudes and quarantine time points. Results The major results suggest that the COVID-19 variations are well captured by the epidemic model with very high accuracy in the cumulative confirmed cases, confirmed cases, cumulative recovered cases and cumulative death cases. The quarantine magnitudes in the susceptible individuals play larger roles on the disease control than the impacts of the quarantines of the exposed individuals and infectious individuals. For the quarantine time points, it shows that the early quarantine strategy is significantly important for the disease controlling. The time delayed quarantining will seriously increase the COVID-19 disease patients and prolongs the days of the disease extinction. Conclusions Our model can simulate and predict the COVID-19 variations and the quarantine strategies are important for the disease controlling, especially at the early period of the disease outbreak. These conclusions provide important scientific information for the government policymaker in the disease control strategies.},

  abstract = {Mapping yellow fever (YF) risk is often based on place of infection of human cases, whereas the circulation between nonhuman primates (NHP) and vectors is neglected. In 2008/2009, YF devastated NHP at the southern limit of the disease in the Americas. In view of the recent expansion of YF in Brazil, we modeled the environmental suitability for YF with data from 2008/2009 epizootic, the distribution of NHP (Alouatta spp.), and the mosquito (Haemagogus leucocelaenus) using the maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent) to define risk areas for YF and their main environmental predictors. We evaluated points of occurrence of YF based on dates of confirmed deaths of NHP in three periods, from October 2008 to: December 2008, March 2009, and June 2009. Variables with greatest influence on suitability for YF were seasonality in water vapor pressure (36\%), distribution of NHP (32\%), maximum wind speed (11\%), annual mean rainfall (7\%), and maximum temperature in the warmest month (5\%). Models of early periods of the epizootic identified suitability for YF in localities that recorded NHP deaths only months later, demonstrating usefulness of the approach for predicting the disease spread. Our data supported influence of rainfall, air humidity, and ambient temperature on the distribution of epizootics. Wind was highlighted as a predicting variable, probably due to its influence on the dispersal of vectors infected with YF in fragmented landscapes. Further studies on the role of wind are necessary to improve our understanding of the occurrence of YF and other arboviruses and their dispersal in the landscape.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Over the last twenty years AI has undergone a sea change. The oncedominant paradigm of logical inference over symbolic knowledge representations has largely been supplanted by statistical methods. The statistical paradigm affords a robustness in the real-world that has eluded symbolic logic. But statistics sacrifices much in expressiveness and inferential richness, which is achieved by first-order logic through the nonlinear interaction and combinatorial interplay among quantified component sentences. We present a new form of Explanation Based Learning in which inference results from two forms of evidence: analytic (support via sound derivation from first-order representations of an expert's conceptualization of a domain) and empirical (corroboration derived from consistency with real-world observations). A simple algorithm provides a first illustration of the approach. Some important properties are proven including tractability and robustness with respect to the real world. 1},

For about 15 years, the use of satellite images for epidemiological purposes has been largely promoted to determine diseases distributions and their variations through time. In some circumstances, when diseases are strongly related to environmental data such as climate, vegetation or land-use, radiation values can be included in prediction models. In other cases, remote sensing data provide information for drawing thematic layers involved in the epidemiological processes, which may differ according to the different ecotypes and ecosystems. According to its final goal, the users can choose from the panel of available radiometers with specific characteristics including spatial resolution and frequency of data.

  abstract = {Abstract Many processes are too complex to be manipulated quantitatively; however, humans succeed by using simple rules of thumb that are extracted from their experiences. Fuzzy logic emulates the human reasoning in the use of imprecise information to generate decisions. Unlike traditional approaches, which require a mathematical understanding of the system, fuzzy logic comprises an alternative way of processing, which permits modeling complex systems through the use of human knowledge. On the other hand, several new metaheuristic algorithms have recently been proposed with interesting results. Most of them use operators based on metaphors of natural or social elements to evolve candidate solutions. In this paper, a methodology to implement human-knowledge-based optimization strategies is presented. In the scheme, a Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy inference system is used to reproduce a specific search strategy generated by a human expert. Therefore, the number of rules and its configuration only depend on the expert experience without considering any learning rule process. Under these conditions, each fuzzy rule represents an expert observation that models the conditions under which candidate solutions are modified in order to reach the optimal location. To exhibit the performance and robustness of the proposed method, a comparison to other well-known optimization methods is conducted. The comparison considers several standard benchmark functions which are typically found in scientific literature. The results suggest a high performance of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {In speedup-learning problems, where full descriptions of operators are known, both explanation-based learning (EBL) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be applied. This paper shows that both methods involve fundamentally the same process of propagating information backward from the goal toward the starting state. Most RL methods perform this propagation on a state-by-state basis, while EBL methods compute the weakest preconditions of operators, and hence, perform this propagation on a region-by-region basis. Barto, Bradtke, and Singh (1995) have observed that many algorithms for reinforcement learning can be viewed as asynchronous dynamic programming. Based on this observation, this paper shows how to develop dynamic programming versions of EBL, which we call region-based dynamic programming or Explanation-Based Reinforcement Learning (EBRL). The paper compares batch and online versions of EBRL to batch and online versions of point-based dynamic programming and to standard EBL. The results show that region-based dynamic programming combines the strengths of EBL (fast learning and the ability to scale to large state spaces) with the strengths of reinforcement learning algorithms (learning of optimal policies). Results are shown in chess endgames and in synthetic maze tasks.},

This method performs basic segmentation and fine segmentation based on the varying spacing thresholds and the minimum variance criteria. The five most probable ways of segmentation are derived from this stage and all the possible segments are extracted and recognized. A lattice is created from all the segments and searched using a viterbi based algorithm to find the most likely character sequence. The algorithm presented in this paper provides large flexibility and robustness to handle free-format continuous Chinese handwriting and is a promising solution for a natural and fast Chinese pen input system. The character accuracy is 85.0\% for on-line and 77.4\% for the off-line test data.},

One potentially important piece of information for forecasting COVID-19 cases is mobile device location data that measure the amount of time an individual spends at home. Endemic--epidemic (EE) time series models are recently proposed autoregressive models where the current mean case count is modelled as a weighted average of past case counts multiplied by an autoregressive rate, plus an endemic component. We extend EE models to include a distributed-lag model in order to investigate the association between mobility and the number of reported COVID-19 cases; we additionally include a weekly first-order random walk to capture additional temporal variation. Further, we introduce a shifted negative binomial weighting scheme for the past counts that is more flexible than previously proposed weighting schemes. We perform inference under a Bayesian framework to incorporate parameter uncertainty into model forecasts. We illustrate our methods using data from four US counties.},

  abstract = {Long-term decline and depression of density in cyclic small rodents is a recent widespread phenomenon. These observed changes at the population level might have cascading effects at the ecosystem level. Here, we assessed relationships between changing boreal landscapes and biodiversity changes of small mammal communities. We also inferred potential effects of observed community changes for increased transmission risk of Puumala virus (PUUV) spread, causing the zoonotic disease nephropatica epidemica in humans. Analyses were based on long-term (1971--2013) monitoring data of shrews and voles representing 58 time series in northern Sweden. We calculated richness, diversity, and evenness at alpha, beta, and gamma level, partitioned beta diversity into turnover (species replacement) and nestedness (species addition/removal), used similarity percentages (SIMPER) analysis to assess community structure, and calculated the cumulated number of PUUV-infected bank voles and average PUUV prevalence (percentage of infected bank voles) per vole cycle. Alpha, beta, and gamma richness and diversity of voles, but not shrews, showed long-term trends that varied spatially. The observed patterns were associated with an increase in community contribution of bank vole (Myodes glareolus), a decrease of gray-sided vole (M. rufocanus) and field vole (Microtus agrestis) and a hump-shaped variation in contribution of common shrew (Sorex araneus). Long-term biodiversity changes were largely related to changes in forest landscape structure. Number of PUUV-infected bank voles in spring was negatively related to beta and gamma diversity, and positively related to turnover of shrews (replaced by voles) and to community contribution of bank voles. The latter was also positively related to average PUUV prevalence in spring. We showed that long-term changes in the boreal landscape contributed to explain the decrease in biodiversity and the change in structure of small mammal communities. In addition, our results suggest decrease in small mammal diversity to have knock-on effects on dynamics of infectious diseases among small mammals with potential implications for disease transmission to humans.},

We performed snap-trapping in permanent trapping plots in clear-cuts (n = 3), unburnt reference forests (n = 7), and the fire area (n = 7) and surveyed vegetation and habitat structure. Small mammal species richness was low in all habitats (at maximum three species per trapping session), and the bank vole was the only small mammal species encountered in the fire area after the first postfire year. In autumns of years of peak rodent densities, the trapping index of bank voles was lowest in the fire area, and in two of three peak-density years, it was highest in clear-cuts. Age structure of bank voles varied among forest types with dominance of overwintered breeders in the fire area in the first postfire spring. PUUV infection probability in bank voles was positively related to vole age. Infection probability was highest in the fire area due to low habitat complexity in burnt forests, which possibly increased encounter rate among bank voles. Our results suggest that forest fires induce cascading effects, including fast recovery/recolonization of fire areas by generalists like bank voles, impoverished species richness of small mammals, and altered prevalence of a rodent-borne zoonotic pathogen. Our pilot study suggests high human infection risk upon encountering a bank vole in the fire area, however, with even higher overall risk in unburnt forests due to their higher vole numbers.},

  abstract = {Background Health outcomes and causality are usually assessed with individual level sociodemographic variables. Studies that consider only individual-level variables can suffer from residual confounding. This can result in individual variables that are unrelated to risk behaving as proxies for uncaptured information. There is a scarcity of literature on risk factors for snakebite. In this study, we evaluate the individual-level risk factors of snakebite in Sri Lanka and highlight the impact of spatial confounding on determining the individual-level risk effects. Methods Data was obtained from the National Snakebite Survey of Sri Lanka. This was an Island-wide community-based survey. The survey sampled 165,665 individuals from all 25 districts of the country. We used generalized linear models to identify individual-level factors that contribute to an individual's risk of experiencing a snakebite event. We fitted separate models to assess risk factors with and without considering spatial variation in snakebite incidence in the country. Results Both spatially adjusted and non-adjusted models revealed that middle-aged people, males, field workers and individuals with low level of education have high risk of snakebites. The model without spatial adjustment showed an interaction between ethnicity and income levels. When the model included a spatial adjustment for the overall snakebite incidence, this interaction disappeared and income level appeared as an independent risk factor. Both models showed similar effect sizes for gender and age. HEmployment and education showed lower effect sizes in the spatially adjusted model. Conclusions Both individual-level characteristics and local snakebite incidence are important to determine snakebite risk at a given location. Individual level variables could act as proxies for underling residual spatial variation when environmental information is not considered. This can lead to misinterpretation of risk factors and biased estimates of effect sizes. Both individual-level and environmental variables are important in assessing causality in epidemiological studies.},

  abstract = {Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease that has been overlooked by healthcare decision makers in many countries. Previous studies have reported seasonal variation in hospital admission rates due to snakebites in endemic countries including Sri Lanka, but seasonal patterns have not been investigated in detail.A national community-based survey was conducted during the period of August 2012 to June 2013. The survey used a multistage cluster design, sampled 165\,665 individuals living in 44\,136 households and recorded all recalled snakebite events that had occurred during the preceding year. Log-linear models were fitted to describe the expected number of snakebites occurring in each month, taking into account seasonal trends and weather conditions, and addressing the effects of variation in survey effort during the study and of recall bias amongst survey respondents.Snakebite events showed a clear seasonal variation. Typically, snakebite incidence is highest during November--December followed by March--May and August, but this can vary between years due to variations in relative humidity, which is also a risk factor. Low relative-humidity levels are associated with high snakebite incidence. If current climate-change projections are correct, this could lead to an increase in the annual snakebite burden of 31.3\% (95\% confidence interval: 10.7--55.7) during the next 25--50\,years.Snakebite in Sri Lanka shows seasonal variation. Additionally, more snakebites can be expected during periods of lower-than-expected humidity. Global climate change is likely to increase the incidence of snakebite in Sri Lanka.},

  abstract = {Introduction Sri Lanka has a population of 21 million and about 80,000 snakebites occur annually. However, there are limited data on health seeking behavior following bites. We investigated the effects of snakebite and envenoming on health seeking behavior in Sri Lanka. Methods In a community-based island-wide survey conducted in Sri Lanka 44,136 households were sampled using a multistage cluster sampling method. An individual who reported experiencing a snakebite within the preceding 12 months was considered a case. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain details of the bite and health seeking behavior among cases. Results Among 165,665 individuals surveyed, there were 695 snakebite victims. 682 (98.1\%) had sought health care after the bite; 381 (54.8\%) sought allopathic treatment and 301 (43.3\%) sought traditional treatment. 323 (46.5\%) had evidence of probable envenoming, among them 227 (70.3\%) sought allopathic treatment, 94 (29.1\%) sought traditional treatment and 2 did not seek treatment. There was wide geographic variation in the proportion of seeking allopathic treatment from {$<$}20\% in the Western province to {$>$} 90\% in the Northern province. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that seeking allopathic treatment was independently associated with being systemically envenomed (Odds Ratio = 1.99, 95\% CI: 1.36--2.90, P {$<$} 0.001), distance to the healthcare facility (OR = 1.13 per kilometer, 95\% CI: 1.09 to 1.17, P {$<$} 0.001), time duration from the bite (OR = 0.49 per day, 95\% CI: 0.29--0.74, P = 0.002), and the local incidence of envenoming (OR = 1.31 for each 50 per 100,000, 95\% CI: 1.19--1.46, P {$<$} 0.001) and snakebite (OR = 0.90 for each 50 per 100,000, 95\% CI: 0.85--0.94, P {$<$} 0.001) in the relevant geographic area. Conclusions In Sri Lanka, both allopathic and traditional treatments are sought following snakebite. The presence of probable envenoming was a major contribution to seeking allopathic treatment.},

  abstract = {Background There is a paucity of robust epidemiological data on snakebite, and data available from hospitals and localized or time-limited surveys have major limitations. No study has investigated the incidence of snakebite across a whole country. We undertook a community-based national survey and model based geostatistics to determine incidence, envenoming, mortality and geographical pattern of snakebite in Sri Lanka. Methodology/Principal Findings The survey was designed to sample a population distributed equally among the nine provinces of the country. The number of data collection clusters was divided among districts in proportion to their population. Within districts clusters were randomly selected. Population based incidence of snakebite and significant envenoming were estimated. Model-based geostatistics was used to develop snakebite risk maps for Sri Lanka. 1118 of the total of 14022 GN divisions with a population of 165665 (0.8\%of the country's population) were surveyed. The crude overall community incidence of snakebite, envenoming and mortality were 398 (95\% CI: 356--441), 151 (130--173) and 2.3 (0.2--4.4) per 100000 population, respectively. Risk maps showed wide variation in incidence within the country, and snakebite hotspots and cold spots were determined by considering the probability of exceeding the national incidence. Conclusions/Significance This study provides community based incidence rates of snakebite and envenoming for Sri Lanka. The within-country spatial variation of bites can inform healthcare decision making and highlights the limitations associated with estimates of incidence from hospital data or localized surveys. Our methods are replicable, and these models can be adapted to other geographic regions after re-estimating spatial covariance parameters for the particular region.},

We focus on small-area analyses, encompassing disease mapping, geographic correlation studies, disease clusters, and clustering. Advances in geographic information systems, statistical methodology, and availability of high-resolution, geographically referenced health and environmental quality data have created unprecedented new opportunities to investigate environmental and other factors in explaining local geographic variations in disease. They also present new challenges. Problems include the large random component that may predominate disease rates across small areas. Though this can be dealt with appropriately using Bayesian statistics to provide smooth estimates of disease risks, sensitivity to detect areas at high risk is limited when expected numbers of cases are small. Potential biases and confounding, particularly due to socioeconomic factors, and a detailed understanding of data quality are important. Data errors can result in large apparent disease excess in a locality. Disease cluster reports often arise nonsystematically because of media, physician, or public concern. One ready means of investigating such concerns is the replication of analyses in different areas based on routine data, as is done in the United Kingdom through the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (and increasingly in other European countries, e.g., through the European Health and Environment Information System collaboration). In the future, developments in exposure modeling and mapping, enhanced study designs, and new methods of surveillance of large health databases to improve our ability to understand the complex relationships of environment to health.},

In East Africa, human cases of YFV are characterized by unpredictable focal periodicity, lengthy inter-epidemic periods, and a precarious potential for large epidemics. YFV had remained undetected in this region for nearly 40 years until emerging in Kenya in 1992--93 and more recently in Sudan during 2003 and 2005. From an ecological perspective the emergence and epidemiological outcomes associated with YFV, and related vector-borne diseases, are critically dependent upon the underlying vector ecology at a local scale. The study here was aimed at defining the dynamics of important vector interactions at two important sites in Kenya with previous YFV or related arbovirus activity. The temporal abundance, spatial distribution, and human host seeking behavior of diurnal man-landing mosquito species along sylvan interfaces were investigated. A number of YFV vectors were identified including their abundances for the duration of the main rainy season. Spatially, results indicated that the greatest human-mosquito interactions occurred within the forest and decreased across more domesticated biotopes. A discussion of significant differences, ecological associations, and epidemiological implications is included. Key Words: Ades---Vector---Mosquito(es)---Field Studies---Arbovirus(es).

Unlike other factors that are relatively stable over time, LULC is a dynamic factor associated with human activities. This study evaluates the impact of LULC change on landslide susceptibility in the Rangamati municipality of Rangamati district, Bangladesh, based on three LULC scenarios---the existing (2018) LULC, the proposed LULC (proposed in 2010, but not yet implemented), and the simulated LULC of 2028---using artificial neural network (ANN)-based cellular automata. The random forest model was used for landslide susceptibility mapping. The model showed good accuracy for all three LULC scenarios (existing: 82.7\%; proposed: 81.4\%; and 2028: 78.3\%) and strong positive correlations ({$>$}0.8) between different landslide susceptibility maps. LULC is either the third or fourth most important factor in these scenarios, suggesting that is has a moderate impact on landslide susceptibility. Future LULC changes will likely increase landslide susceptibility, with up to 14.5\% increases in the high susceptibility zone for both the proposed and simulated LULC scenarios. These findings may help policymakers carry out proper urban planning and highlight the importance of considering landslide susceptibility in LULC planning.},

For many vector species, multiple indices of abundance are available, but current approaches to choosing between or combining these indices do not fully exploit the potential inferential benefits that might accrue from modelling their joint spatial distribution. Here, we develop a class of multivariate generalized linear geostatistical models for multiple indices of abundance. We illustrate this novel methodology with a case study on Norway rats in a low-income urban Brazilian community, where rat abundance is a likely risk factor for human leptospirosis. We combine three indices of rat abundance to draw predictive inferences on a spatially continuous latent process, rattiness, that acts as a proxy for abundance. We show how to explore the association between rattiness and spatially varying environmental factors, evaluate the relative importance of each of the three contributing indices and assess the presence of residual, unexplained spatial variation, and identify rattiness hotspots. The proposed methodology is applicable more generally as a tool for understanding the role of vector or reservoir host abundance in predicting spatial variation in the risk of human disease.},

Specifically, we work with a model for A/H1N1 influenza, which is implemented as a deterministic computer simulator, taking as input the underlying epidemic parameters and calculating the corresponding time series of reported infections. To obtain Bayesian inference for the epidemic parameters, the simulator is embedded in the likelihood for the reported epidemic data. However, the simulator is computationally slow, making it impractical to use in Bayesian estimation where a large number of simulator runs is required. We propose an efficient approximation to the simulator using an emulator, a statistical model that combines a Gaussian process (GP) prior for the output function of the simulator with a dynamic linear model (DLM) for its evolution through time. This modeling framework is both flexible and tractable, resulting in efficient posterior inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The proposed dynamic emulator is then used in a calibration procedure to obtain posterior inference for the parameters of the influenza epidemic.},

The number of cases per week from June 2014 until September 2015 reveals two distinct transmission waves. The first wave ignited in June and transmission ceased by December 2014.

It describes an empirical study that evaluates three methods for solving this problem: explanation-based generalization (EBG), multiple example explanation-based generalization (mEBG), and a new method, induction over explanations (IOE). The study demonstrates that the two existing methods (EBG and mEBG) exhibit two shortcomings: (a) they rarely identify the correct definition, and (b) they are brittle in that their success depends greatly on the choice of encoding of the domain theory rules. The study demonstrates that the new method, IOE, does not exhibit these shortcomings. This method applies the domain theory to construct explanations from multiple training examples as in mEBG, but forms the concept definition by employing a similarity-based generalization policy over the explanations. IOE has the advantage that an explicit domain theory can be exploited to aid the learning process, the dependence on the initial encoding of the domain theory is significantly reduced, and the correct concepts can be learned from few examples. The study evaluates the methods in the context of an implemented system, called Wyl2 , which learns a variety of concepts in chess including ``skewer'' and ``knight-fork.''},

  abstract = {Precise and accurate estimates of abundance and demographic rates are primary quantities of interest within wildlife conservation and management. Such quantities provide insight into population trends over time and the associated underlying ecological drivers of the systems. This information is fundamental in managing ecosystems, assessing species conservation status and developing and implementing effective conservation policy. Observational monitoring data are typically collected on wildlife populations using an array of different survey protocols, dependent on the primary questions of interest. For each of these survey designs, a range of advanced statistical techniques have been developed which are typically well understood. However, often multiple types of data may exist for the same population under study. Analyzing each data set separately implicitly discards the common information contained in the other data sets. An alternative approach that aims to optimize the shared information contained within multiple data sets is to use a ``model-based data integration'' approach, or more commonly referred to as an ``integrated model.'' This integrated modeling approach simultaneously analyzes all the available data within a single, and robust, statistical framework. This paper provides a statistical overview of ecological integrated models, with a focus on integrated population models (IPMs) which include abundance and demographic rates as quantities of interest. Four main challenges within this area are discussed, namely model specification, computational aspects, model assessment and forecasting. This should encourage researchers to explore further and develop new practical tools to ensure that full utility can be made of IPMs for future studies.},

We aimed to identify environmental drivers of arbovirus epidemics to predict where the next epidemics will occur and prioritize municipalities for vector control and eventual vaccination. We screened sera and urine samples (n = 10,459) from residents of 48 municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro for CHIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and ZIKV by molecular PCR diagnostics. Further, we assessed the spatial pattern of arbovirus incidence at the municipal and neighborhood scales and the timing of epidemics and major rainfall events. Lab-confirmed cases included 1,717 infections with ZIKV (43.8\%) and 2,170 with CHIKV (55.4\%) and only 29 ({$<$}1\%) with DENV. ZIKV incidence was greater in neighborhoods with little access to municipal water infrastructure (r = -0.47, p = 1.2x10-8). CHIKV incidence was weakly correlated with urbanization (r = 0.2, p = 0.02). Rains began in October 2015 and were followed one month later by the largest wave of ZIKV epidemic. ZIKV cases markedly declined in February 2016, which coincided with the start of a CHIKV outbreak. Rainfall predicted ZIKV and CHIKV with a lead time of 3 weeks each time. The association between rainfall and epidemics reflects vector ecology as the larval stages of Aedes aegypti require pools of water to develop. The temporal dynamics of ZIKV and CHIKV may be explained by the shorter incubation period of the viruses in the mosquito vector; 2 days for CHIKV versus 10 days for ZIKV.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate representations of mean climate conditions, especially in areas of complex terrain, are an important part of environmental monitoring systems. As high-resolution satellite monitoring information accumulates with the passage of time, it can be increasingly useful in efforts to better characterize the earth's mean climatology. Current state-of-the-science products rely on complex and sometimes unreliable relationships between elevation and station-based precipitation records, which can result in poor performance in food and water insecure regions with sparse observation networks. These vulnerable areas (like Ethiopia, Afghanistan, or Haiti) are often the critical regions for humanitarian drought monitoring. Here, we show that long period of record geo-synchronous and polar-orbiting satellite observations provide a unique new resource for producing high resolution (0.05{$^\circ$}) global precipitation climatologies that perform reasonably well in data sparse regions.  Traditionally, global climatologies have been produced by combining station observations and physiographic predictors like latitude, longitude, elevation, and slope. While such approaches can work well, especially in areas with reasonably dense observation networks, the fundamental relationship between physiographic variables and the target climate variables can often be indirect and spatially complex. Infrared and microwave satellite observations, on the other hand, directly monitor the earth's energy emissions. These emissions often correspond physically with the location and intensity of precipitation. We show that these relationships provide a good basis for building global climatologies. We also introduce a new geospatial modeling approach based on moving window regressions and inverse distance weighting interpolation. This approach combines satellite fields, gridded physiographic indicators, and in situ climate normals. The resulting global 0.05{$^\circ$} monthly precipitation climatology, the Climate Hazards Group's Precipitation Climatology version 1 (CHPclim v.1.0, http://dx.doi.org/10.15780/G2159X), is shown to compare favorably with similar global climatology products, especially in areas with complex terrain and low station densities.},

The aim of this study is to present an accurate model for predicting the rock fragmentation (D80) induced by blasting in Shur river dam region, Iran, through Gaussian process regression (GPR). For this aim, 72 blasting events were investigated and the values of six parameters, i.e. burden, spacing, stemming, powder factor, charge used per delay and D80 were measured. Firstly, 80\% of the total data (58 datasets) were assigned to train the GPR, whereas the remaining 14 datasets were assigned to test the constructed GPR model. In GPR modeling, 5 different kernels, i.e. squared exponential, exponential, matern32, matern52 and rational quadratic, were employed. The proposed GPR models were then compared with the support vector machines (SVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and hybrid ANFIS-particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results proved that the GPR-squared exponential model with the R-square (R2) of 0.948 can forecast D80 better than the SVM with the R2 of 0.83, ANFIS with the R2 of 0.81 and ANFIS-PSO with the R2 of 0.89.},

Such methods go well beyond the conventional 'nearest-neighbour' and 'quadrat' analyses {\textbackslash}vhich have little to offer in an epidemiological context because they fail to allow for spatial variation in population density. Correction for this is essential if the aim is to assess the evidence for 'clustering' of cases of disease. We examine methods for exploring spatial variation in disease risk, spatial and space-time clustering, and we consider methods for modelling the raised incidence of disease around suspected point sources of pollution. All methods are illustrated by reference to recent case studies including child cancer incidence, Burkitt's lymphoma, cancer of the larynx and childhood asthma. An Appendix considers a range of possible software environments within which to apply these methods. The links to modern geographical information systems are discussed. {\copyright}Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) 1996.},

We illustrate the different stages of the analysis, from exploratory analysis to spatial prediction of prevalence, through a case study on malaria mapping in Tanzania. Throughout the paper, we distinguish between predictive modelling, whose main focus is on maximizing the predictive accuracy of the model, and explanatory modelling, where greater emphasis is placed on understanding the relationships between the health outcome and risk factors. We demonstrate that these two paradigms can result in different modelling choices. We also propose a simple approach for detecting over-fitting based on inspection of the correlation matrix of the estimators of the regression coefficients. To enhance the interpretability of geostatistical models, we introduce the concept of domain effects in order to assist variable selection and model validation. The statistical ideas and principles illustrated here in the specific context of disease prevalence mapping are more widely applicable to any regression model for the analysis of epidemiological outcomes but are particularly relevant to geostatistical models, for which the separation between fixed and random effects can be ambiguous.},

Determining the timing and spatial corridors of YFV spread, as well as the geographic hotspots that link the endemic north of the country with epidemic extra-Amazonian regions, are central to predicting and preventing future outbreak events and epidemics. Here, we tracked the recent spread of the virus by integrating genome sequences of new YFV infections sampled from infected non-human primates and humans with both epidemiological and vector data. Through a combination of phylogenetic and epidemiological models we reconstructed the recent transmission history of YFV within different epidemic seasons in Brazil. A suitability index based on the highly domesticated Aedes aegypti was able to capture the seasonality of reported human infections. Spatial modelling revealed spatial hotspots with both past reporting and low vaccination coverage, which coincided with many of the largest urban centres in the Southeast. Phylodynamic analysis unravelled the circulation of three distinct YFV lineages, and provided proof of the directionality of a known spatial corridor of viral spread that connects the endemic North with the extra-Amazonian basin. This study illustrates that genomics linked with field sampling of animals and humans within a One Health framework can provide new insights into the landscape of YFV transmission, augmenting traditional approaches to infectious disease surveillance and control.},

The virus quickly spread worldwide through human-to-human transmission. In view of the number of countries and communities which were reporting human cases, the World Health Organization raised the influenza pandemic alert to the highest level (level 6) on June 11, 2009. The propensity of the virus to primarily affect children, young adults and pregnant women, especially those with an underlying lung or cardiac disease condition, and the substantial increase in rate of hospitalizations, prompted the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry, including new manufacturers from China, Thailand, India and South America, to develop pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccines. All currently registered vaccines were tested for safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials on human volunteers. All were found to be safe and to elicit potentially protective antibody responses after the administration of a single dose of vaccine, including split inactivated vaccines with or without adjuvant, whole-virion vaccines and live-attenuated vaccines. The need for an increased surveillance of influenza virus circulation in swine is outlined. {\copyright} 2010.},

  abstract = {Snakebite affects more than 1.8 million people annually. Factors explaining snakebite variability include farmers' behaviors, snake ecology and climate. One unstudied issue is how farmers' adaptation to novel climates affect their health. Here we examined potential impacts of adaptation on snakebite using individual-based simulations, focusing on strategies meant to counteract major crop yield decline because of changing rainfall in Sri Lanka. For rubber cropping, adaptation led to a 33\% increase in snakebite incidence per farmer work hour because of work during risky months, but a 17\% decrease in total annual snakebites because of decreased labor in plantations overall. Rice farming adaptation decreased snakebites by 16\%, because of shifting labor towards safer months, whereas tea adaptation led to a general increase. These results indicate that adaptation could have both a positive and negative effect, potentially intensified by ENSO. Our research highlights the need for assessing adaptation strategies for potential health maladaptations.},

  abstract = {In the last 20 years yellow fever (YF) has seen dramatic changes to its incidence and geographic extent, with the largest outbreaks in South America since 1940 occurring in the previously unaffected South-East Atlantic coast of Brazil in 2016--2019. While habitat fragmentation and land-cover have previously been implicated in zoonotic disease, their role in YF has not yet been examined. We examined the extent to which vegetation, land-cover, climate and host population predicted the numbers of months a location reported YF per year and by each month over the time-period. Two sets of models were assessed, one looking at interannual differences over the study period (2003--2016), and a seasonal model looking at intra-annual differences by month, averaging over the years of the study period. Each was fit using hierarchical negative-binomial regression in an exhaustive model fitting process. Within each set, the best performing models, as measured by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), were combined to create ensemble models to describe interannual and seasonal variation in YF. The models reproduced the spatiotemporal heterogeneities in YF transmission with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.43 (95\% CI 0.41--0.45) for the interannual model and 0.66 (95\% CI 0.64--0.67) for the seasonal model. For the interannual model, EVI, land-cover and vegetation heterogeneity were the primary contributors to the variance explained by the model, and for the seasonal model, EVI, day temperature and rainfall amplitude. Our models explain much of the spatiotemporal variation in YF in South America, both seasonally and across the period 2003--2016. Vegetation type (EVI), heterogeneity in vegetation (perhaps a proxy for habitat fragmentation) and land cover explain much of the trends in YF transmission seen. These findings may help understand the recent expansions of the YF endemic zone, as well as to the highly seasonal nature of YF.},

  abstract = {Background In the Americas, yellow fever virus transmission is a latent threat due to the proximity between urban and wild environments. Although yellow fever has nearly vanished from North and Central America, there are still 13 countries in the Americas considered endemic by the World Health Organization. Human cases usually occur as a result of the exposure to sylvatic yellow fever in tropical forested environments; but urban outbreaks reported during the last decade demonstrate that the risk in this environment still exists. The objective of this study was to identify spatial patterns and the relationship between key geographic and environmental factors with the distribution of yellow fever human cases in the Americas. Methodology/Principal findings An ecological study was carried out to analyze yellow fever human cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization from 2000 to 2014, aggregated by second administrative level subdivisions (counties). Presence of yellow fever by county was used as the outcome variable and eight geo-environmental factors were used as independent variables. Spatial analysis was performed to identify and examine natural settings per county. Subsequently, a multivariable logistic regression model was built. During the study period, 1,164 cases were reported in eight out of the 13 endemic countries. Nearly 83.8\% of these cases were concentrated in three countries: Peru (37.4\%), Brazil (28.1\%) and Colombia (18.4\%); and distributed in 57 states/provinces, specifically in 286 counties (3.4\% of total counties). Yellow fever presence was significantly associated with altitude, rain, diversity of non-human primate hosts and temperature. A positive spatial autocorrelation revealed a clustered geographic pattern in 138/286 yellow fever positive counties (48.3\%). Conclusions/Significance A clustered geographic pattern of yellow fever was identified mostly along the Andes eastern foothills. This risk map could support health policies in endemic countries. Geo-environmental factors associated with presence of yellow fever could help predict and adjust the limits of other risk areas of epidemiological concern.},

Since most existing methods and models aim to on-line and/or text-dependent writer identification, it is necessary to propose new methods for off-line, text-independent writer identification. At present, two-dimensional Gabor model is widely acknowledged as an effective and classic method for off-line, text-independent handwriting identification, while it still suffers from some inherent shortcomings, such as the excessive calculational cost. In this paper, we present a novel method based on hidden Markov tree (HMT) model in wavelet domain for off-line, text-independent writer identification of Chinese handwriting documents. Our experiments show this HMT method, compared with two-dimensional Gabor model, not only achieves better identification results but also greatly reduces the elapsed time on computation.},

Despite the potential of remote-sensed images and processing techniques for a better knowledge of disease dynamics, an exhaustive analysis of the bibliography shows a generalized use of pre-processed spatial data and low-cost images, resulting in a limited adaptability when addressing biological questions. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper an overview of different control methods is given and a new rule-based EMS is introduced, based on the combination of Rule-Based and Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategies (RB-ECMS). The RB-ECMS uses only one decision variable and requires no tuning of many threshold control values and parameters. This decision variable represents the maximum propulsion power of the secondary power source (i.e. electric machine/battery) during pure electric driving. The RB-ECMS is compared with the strategy based on Dynamic Programming (DP), which is inherently optimal for a given cycle. The RB-ECMS proposed in this paper requires significantly less computation time with a similar result to DP (within 1\% accuracy).},

The information from these datasets was used to reclassify them into three levels of risk: high, moderate and low risk. The weighted overlay tool in ArcGIS 10.7 was used to assign weight values to the datasets according to their risk components to generate the compound risk map. Results revealed great disparities in the risk levels of the datasets across the wards. It also shows that 37.5\%, 56.1\% and 6.4\% of wards in the study area were at high, moderate and low compound risk in their health system.

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

ABA also uses a concept hierarchy for problem descriptions to modify a similar case for case adaptation efficiently. The major steps ofABA are SEARCH, ABSTRACT, REFINE, APPLY, and VERIFY. These steps are designed generally so that they can be applied to various task domains in synthesis type of expert systems.

The model predicts the number of life-cycle completions (LCC) for a given location per unit time based on empirically derived biophysical responses to environmental conditions. Results suggest that the world became {\textasciitilde}1.5\% more suitable per decade for the development of Ae. aegypti during 1950--2000, while this trend is predicted to accelerate to 3.2--4.4\% per decade by 2050. Invasion fronts in North America and China are projected to accelerate from {\textasciitilde}2 to 6\,km/yr by 2050. An increase in peak LCC combined with extended periods suitable for mosquito development is simulated to accelerate the vector's global invasion potential.},

The objective of spatial epidemiology is to identify disease causes and correlates by relating spatial disease patterns to geographic variation in health risks. GIS supports disease mapping, location analysis, the characterization of populations, and spatial statistics and modeling. Although laudable, these accomplishments are not sufficient to fully identify disease causes and correlates. One reason is the failure of present-day GIS to provide tools appropriate for epidemiology. Two needs are most pressing. First, we must reject the static view: meaningful inference about the causes of disease is impossible without both spatial and temporal information. Second, we need models that translate space-time data on health outcomes and putative exposures into epidemiologically meaningful measures. The first need will be met by the design and implementation of space-time information systems for epidemiology; the second by process-based disease models.},

The strategy is based on splitting the power demand between the engine and the battery such that these power sources are operated at high efficiency. The power demand is estimated as the output of a high gain PI controller that controls the longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle. The focus was to improve the fuel economy of the vehicle by suitable power assignment to the power sources. This power split (assignment) is implemented under a rule-base frame. The rules depend on the values of selected variables: the power demand itself, the driver's acceleration command and the status of the SOC (state of charge) of the battery. The rules ensure that the engine and the battery operate at high efficiency whenever possible. At high power demand the engine will operate at its maximum rated power. Simulation results of the proposed strategy showed improvement in fuel economy over the \&ldquo;thermostat\&rdquo; strategy. An improvement of 11\% in the urban cycle and of 6\% in the highway cycle have been achieved for a series hybrid vehicle driven by a 40 KW diesel engine and a 60 kW lead acid battery},

A proper load management strategy is important for both better system efficiency and endurance of hybrid systems. In this paper, a fuzzy logic algorithm has been used to determine the fuel cell output power depending on the external power requirement and the battery state of charge (SoC). If the power requirement of the hybrid system is low and the SoC is low, then the greater part of the fuel cell power is used to charge the battery pack. If the power requirement is relatively high and the SoC is also high, then the fuel cell and the battery are concurrently used to supply the required power. These if--then operation rules are implemented by fuzzy logic for the energy management of the hybrid system.},

  abstract = {Background Dengue and chikungunya are mosquito-borne viral diseases of major global health concern. In Tanzania, information on risk factors for dengue and chikungunya is limited. We investigated individual, household, socio-economic, demographic and environmental risk factors for dengue and chikungunya seropositivity. Methods A cross sectional study was undertaken which included a total of 1003 participants from North-Eastern Tanzania, to determine the sero-prevalence of dengue and chikungunya and to investigate associated risk factors. Logistic regression models were used to determine the risk factors for dengue and chikungunya seropositivity. Results Environmental factors such as living in a house with uncovered containers within the compound had higher odds of being chikungunya IgM seropositive (OR~=~2.89; 95\% CI: 1.76--4.76). Also, participants who kept hoofed animals in their home and who lived in a house surrounded by vegetation ({$<$}100~m) had higher odds of chikungunya IgM seropositivity (\{OR~=~1.67; 95\% CI: 1.11--2.51\} and \{OR~=~181; 1.10--3.00\} respectively). Due to few dengue seropositive, dengue was excluded in the bi-and multivariate analysis. However, dengue IgM seropositivity was associated with G6PD status (p~=~0.03) while there was no apparent association between genetic factors (G6PD, HbB or alpha-thalassemia) and chikungunya seropositivity. Conclusion Public health education on environmental management practices is needed to eliminate the identified risks such as simple removal of uncovered containers that may serve as breeding sites for mosquitoes, avoiding animal husbandry in the peri-domestic environment and clearing of vegetation surrounding houses. More studies are needed to investigate the association of dengue and G6PD deficiency.},

Study area is situated in Karakorum mountainous region where catastrophic landslides occur frequently and pose a serious threat to local living conditions. Landslide susceptibility index maps were prepared by combining four main indicators groups: (1) human induced parameters, which contain Landsat 8 imagery and distance from roads; (2) topographical parameters, which include slope, aspect and plan curvature; (3) hydrological parameters, which contain stream power index, topographic wetness index and distance from drainage and (4) geological parameters, which consist of lithology and distance from major thrusts and faults. These layers were prepared in GIS environment, and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) based heuristic approach was adopted to generate final landslide susceptibility map for this preliminary regional level landslide hazard study. Three different susceptibility zones have been identified in the region. AHP weights with 0.04 consistency ratio were used in the preparation of final map. The final landslide susceptibility map of the study area indicates that the low, moderate, and high landslide susceptibility classes are respectively covering 23.2\% (4745 km2), 45\% (6737 km2), 23.2\% (3444 km2) when distance from roads, distance from drainage and distance from major thrusts and faults parameters were not incorporated in the analysis. Including distance from roads, distance from drainage and distance from major thrusts and faults parameters layers to the final landslide susceptibility analysis shows that moderate susceptibility class is the predominant landslide susceptibility category covering 88\% (13,412 km2) of the study area characterized by steep slopes (30{$^\circ$}--45{$^\circ$}), low positive plan curvature (0--1) and weak lithology.},

Yellow fever (YF) re-emerged in the early 2000s, spreading from the Amazon River basin towards the previously considered low-risk, southeastern region of the country. Previous methods mapping YF spillover risk do not incorporate the temporal dynamics and ecological context of the disease, and are therefore unable to predict seasonality in spatial risk across Brazil. We present the results of a bagged logistic regression predicting the propensity for YF spillover per municipality (administrative sub-district) in Brazil from environmental and demographic covariates aggregated by month. Ecological context was incorporated by creating National and Regional models of spillover dynamics, where the Regional model consisted of two separate models determined by the regions' NHP reservoir species richness (high vs low).},

  abstract = {The ``dilution effect'' implies that where species vary in susceptibility to infection by a pathogen, higher diversity often leads to lower infection prevalence in hosts. For directly transmitted pathogens, non-host species may ``dilute'' infection directly (1) and indirectly (2). Competitors and predators may (1) alter host behavior to reduce pathogen transmission or (2) reduce host density. In a well-studied system, we tested the dilution of the zoonotic Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) by two competitors and a predator. Our study was based on long-term PUUV infection data (2003--2013) in northern Sweden. The field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the common shrew (Sorex araneus) are bank vole competitors and Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) is a main predator of bank voles. Infection probability in bank voles decreased when common shrew density increased, suggesting that common shrews reduced PUUV transmission. Field voles suppressed bank vole density in meadows and clear-cuts and indirectly diluted PUUV infection. Further, Tengmalm's owl decline in 1980--2013 may have contributed to higher PUUV infection rates in bank voles in 2003--2013 compared to 1979--1986. Our study provides further evidence for dilution effect and suggests that owls may have an important role in reducing disease risk.},

  abstract = {Pathogenic hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) are rodent-borne viruses causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia. In Europe, there are more than 10,000 yearly cases of nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild form of HFRS caused by Puumala virus (PUUV). The common and widely distributed bank vole (Myodes glareolus) is the host of PUUV. In this study, we aim to explain and predict NE incidence in boreal Sweden using bank vole densities. We tested whether the number of rainy days in winter contributed to variation in NE incidence. We forecast NE incidence in July 2013--June 2014 using projected autumn vole density, and then considering two climatic scenarios: 1) rain-free winter and 2) winter with many rainy days. Autumn vole density was a strong explanatory variable of NE incidence in boreal Sweden in 1990--2012 (R2 = 79\%, p,0.001). Adding the number of rainy winter days improved the model (R2 = 84\%, p,0.05). We report for the first time that risk of NE is higher in winters with many rainy days. Rain on snow and ground icing may block vole access to subnivean space. Seeking refuge from adverse conditions and shelter from predators, voles may infest buildings, increasing infection risk. In a rainy winter scenario, we predicted 812 NE cases in boreal Sweden, triple the number of cases predicted in a rain-free winter in 2013/2014. Our model enables identification of high risk years when preparedness in the public health sector is crucial, as a rainy winter would accentuate risk.},

  abstract = {Predicting risk of zoonotic diseases, i.e., diseases shared by humans and animals, is often complicated by the population ecology of wildlife host(s). We here demonstrate how ecological knowledge of a disease system can be used for early prediction of human risk using Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), which causes Nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans, as a model system. Bank vole populations at northern latitudes exhibit multiannual fluctuations in density and spatial distribution, a phenomenon that has been studied extensively. Nevertheless, existing studies predict NE incidence only a few months before an outbreak. We used a time series on cyclic bank vole population density (1972--2013), their PUUV infection rates (1979--1986; 2003--2013), and NE incidence in Sweden (1990--2013). Depending on the relationship between vole density and infection prevalence (proportion of infected animals), either overall density of bank voles or the density of infected bank voles may be used to predict seasonal NE incidence. The density and spatial distribution of voles at density minima of a population cycle contribute to the early warning of NE risk later at its cyclic peak. When bank voles remain relatively widespread in the landscape during cyclic minima, PUUV can spread from a high baseline during a cycle, culminating in high prevalence in bank voles and potentially high NE risk during peak densities.},

These probabilistic and generalized explanations can then be used to discover similar examples and to reason by analogy . So, whereas traditional explanation based learning is typically used for speed-up learning, probabilistic explanation based learning is used for discovering new knowledge.

This mapping allows us to initialize a new domain theory. After this initialization, another analogy is made between the domain theories themselves, providing additional conjectures about the new domain. We present two experiments in which our model learns rotational kinematics by an analogy with translational kinematics, and vice versa. These learning rates outperform those from a version of the system that is incrementally given the correct domain theory.},

We introduce four different types of prior distributions for space{\texttimes}time interaction in extension of a model with only main effects. Each type implies a certain degree of prior dependence for the interaction parameters, and corresponds to the product of one of the two spatial with one of the two temporal main effects. The methodology is illustrated by an analysis of Ohio lung cancer data 1968--1988 via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. We compare the fit and the complexity of several models with different types of interaction by means of quantities related to the posterior deviance. Our results confirm an epidemiological hypothesis about the temporal development of the association between urbanization and risk factors for cancer.

Early invasion was positively correlated with high population density (Pearson's \emph{r} 0{$\cdot$}52, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}34--0{$\cdot$}66). The further away locations were from Luanda, the later the date of invasion (Pearson's \emph{r} 0{$\cdot$}60, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}52--0{$\cdot$}66). In a Cox model, we noted that districts with higher population densities also had higher risks of sustained transmission (the hazard ratio for cases ceasing was 0{$\cdot$}74, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}13--0{$\cdot$}92 per log-unit increase in the population size of a district). A model that captured human mobility and vector suitability successfully discriminated districts with high risk of invasion from others with a lower risk (area under the curve 0{$\cdot$}94, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}92--0{$\cdot$}97). If at the start of the epidemic, sufficient vaccines had been available to target 50 out of 313 districts in the area, our model would have correctly identified 27 (84\%) of the 32 districts that were eventually affected.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Our findings show the contributions of ecological and demographic factors to the ongoing spread of the yellow fever outbreak and provide estimates of the areas that could be prioritised for vaccination, although other constraints such as vaccine supply and delivery need to be accounted for before such insights can be translated into policy.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Wellcome Trust.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, many of these approaches provide inadequate forms of safety assur- ance required for certification. As a result, neural net- works are typically restricted to advisory roles in safety- related applications. Neural networks have the ability to operate in unpredictable and changing environments. It is therefore desirable to certify them for highly- dependable roles in safety critical systems. This paper outlines the safety criteria which are safety requirements for the behaviour of neural networks. If enforced, the criteria can contribute to justifying the safety of ANN functional properties. Characteristics of potential neural network models are also outlined and are based upon representing knowledge in interpretable and under- standable forms. The paper also presents a safety life- cycle for artificial neural networks. This lifecycle focuses on managing behaviour represented by neural networks and contributes to providing acceptable forms of safety assurance.},

  abstract = {By a linguistic variable we mean a variable whose values are words or sentences in a natural or artificial language. For example, Age is a linguistic variable if its values are linguistic rather than numerical, i.e.,young, not young, very young, quite young, old, not very old and not very young, etc., rather than 20, 21,22, 23, In more specific terms, a linguistic variable is characterized by a quintuple (L\&gt;, T(L), U,G,M) in which L is the name of the variable; T(L) is the term-set of L, that is, the collection of its linguistic values; U is a universe of discourse; G is a syntactic rule which generates the terms in T(L); and M is a semantic rule which associates with each linguistic value X its meaning, M(X), where M(X) denotes a fuzzy subset of U. The meaning of a linguistic value X is characterized by a compatibility function, c: U {$\rightarrow$} [0,1], which associates with each u in U its compatibility with X. Thus, the compatibility of age 27 with young might be 0.7, while that of 35 might be 0.2. The function of the semantic rule is to relate the compatibilities of the so-called primary terms in a composite linguistic value-e.g., young and old in not very young and not very old-to the compatibility of the composite value. To this end, the hedges such as very, quite, extremely, etc., as well as the connectives and and or are treated as nonlinear operators which modify the meaning of their operands in a specified fashion. The concept of a linguistic variable provides a means of approximate characterization of phenomena which are too complex or too ill-defined to be amenable to description in conventional quantitative terms. In particular, treating Truth as a linguistic variable with values such as true, very true, completely true, not very true, untrue, etc., leads to what is called fuzzy logic. By providing a basis for approximate reasoning, that is, a mode of reasoning which is not exact nor very inexact, such logic may offer a more realistic framework for human reasoning than the traditional two-valued logic. It is shown that probabilities, too, can be treated as linguistic variables with values such as likely, very likely, unlikely, etc. Computation with linguistic probabilities requires the solution of nonlinear programs and leads to results which are imprecise to the same degree as the underlying probabilities. The main applications of the linguistic approach lie in the realm of humanistic systems-especially in the fields of artificial intelligence, linguistics, human decision processes, pattern recognition, psychology, law, medical diagnosis, information retrieval, economics and related areas.},

We confirmed 648 human cases of SYF in SP, with 230 deaths and 843 NHP epizootics. Two outbreak waves were identified: one from West to East (2016 and 2017), and another from the Campinas region to the municipalities bordering Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Paran{\'a} and those of the SP coast (2017--2019). The SYF outbreak diffusion process was by contagion. The disease did not exhibit jumps between municipalities, indicating that the mosquitoes and NHPs were responsible for transmitting the virus. There were not enough vaccines to meet the population at risk; hence, health authorities used information about the epizootic occurrence in NHPs in forest fragments to identify priority populations for vaccination.},

  abstract = {Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease in the Pacific Islands. In Fiji, two successive cyclones and severe flooding in 2012 resulted in outbreaks with 576 reported cases and 7\% case-fatality. We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study and used an eco-epidemiological approach to characterize risk factors and drivers for human leptospirosis infection in Fiji, and aimed to provide an evidence base for improving the effectiveness of public health mitigation and intervention strategies. Antibodies indicative of previous or recent infection were found in 19.4\% of 2152 participants (81 communities on the 3 main islands). Questionnaires and geographic information systems data were used to assess variables related to demographics, individual behaviour, contact with animals, socioeconomics, living conditions, land use, and the natural environment. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables associated with the presence of Leptospira antibodies included male gender (OR 1.55), iTaukei ethnicity (OR 3.51), living in villages (OR 1.64), lack of treated water at home (OR 1.52), working outdoors (1.64), living in rural areas (OR 1.43), high poverty rate (OR 1.74), living {$<$}100m from a major river (OR 1.41), pigs in the community (OR 1.54), high cattle density in the district (OR 1.04 per head/sqkm), and high maximum rainfall in the wettest month (OR 1.003 per mm). Risk factors and drivers for human leptospirosis infection in Fiji are complex and multifactorial, with environmental factors playing crucial roles. With global climate change, severe weather events and flooding are expected to intensify in the South Pacific. Population growth could also lead to more intensive livestock farming; and urbanization in developing countries is often associated with urban and peri-urban slums where diseases of poverty proliferate. Climate change, flooding, population growth, urbanization, poverty and agricultural intensification are important drivers of zoonotic disease transmission; these factors may independently, or potentially synergistically, lead to enhanced leptospirosis transmission in Fiji and other similar settings.},

For example, controversy has arisen over transformations of the response (Keene). An alternative approach is to use some member of the family of generalized linear models. However, this raises the issue of selecting the appropriate member, a problem of testing non-nested hypotheses. Standard model selection criteria, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), can be used to resolve problems. These procedures for comparing generalized linear models are applied to checking for difference in T4 cell counts between two disease groups. We conclude that appropriate model selection criteria should be specified in the protocol for any study, including clinical trials, in order that optimal inferences can be drawn about treatment differences. {\copyright} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This work also established prediction models based on empirical findings. Panel regression models with random-effect and fixed-effect specifications were used to investigate the association between the remotely sensed environmental factors and the leptospirosis incidence. The Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics were also applied to detect the spatial patterns of leptospirosis and similar results were found (the R2 values of the random-effect and fixed-effect models were 0.3686 and 0.3684, respectively). The outcome thus indicates that remotely sensed environmental factors possess statistically significant contribution in predicting this disease. The highest association in 3 years was observed in LST (random- effect coefficient = -9.787, p{$<$}0.001; fixed-effect coefficient = -10.340, p = 0.005) followed by rainfall (random-effect coefficient = 1.353, p {$<$}0.001; fixed-effect coefficient = 1.347, p {$<$}0.001) and NTL density (random-effect coefficient = -0.569, p = 0.004; fixed-effect coefficient = -0.564, p = 0.001). All results obtained from the bivariate LISA statistics indicated the localised associations between remotely sensed environmental factors and the incidence of leptospirosis. Particularly, LISA's results showed that the border provinces in the northeast, the northern and the southern regions displayed clusters of high leptospirosis incidence. All obtained outcomes thus show that remotely sensed environmental factors can be applied to panel regression models for incidence prediction, and these indicators can also identify the spatial concentration of leptospirosis in Thailand.},

In Europe, Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) carried and shed by the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), is the most common cause of HFRS. We explore the relationship of PUUV infection in bank voles, as measured by PUUV antibody detection, with habitat and landscape scale properties during two successive vole cycles in boreal Sweden. Our analysis revealed that PUUV infection in the population was not uniform between cycles and across different landscapes. The mean density index of PUUV antibody positive and negative bank voles were highest in old forest, second highest in cut-over forest (approx. 0--30 years old) and lowest on mires. Most importantly, old forest was the core habitat, where PUUV antibody positive bank voles were found through the low density phase and the transition between successive vole cycles. In spring, occurrence of antibody positive voles was negatively related to the proportion of cut-over forest in the surrounding landscape, suggesting that large scale human induced land-use change altered the occurrence of PUUV infection in voles which has not been shown before. Dependence of PUUV infection on habitat and landscape structure, and the variation in infection load within and between cycles are of importance for human risk assessment.},

YF disease was confirmed by a specific neutralizing antibody response to YFV in the serum or finding of YFV RNA.Findings: We detected 884 (4\%) cases that were positive on ELISA and RT-PCR assays. Patients were reported from 16 provinces of Angola. The initial case definition for YF was fever and jaundice, with at least one of the following symptoms: headache, asthenia, conjunctivitis, or vomiting, during the epidemic, other symptoms such as hemorrhagic manifestations criteria that had a different type of haemorrhage were included. The incidence of YF was higher in all age groups of boys than in girls. The incidence was approximately three times as high among male patients (10.88\% per 100,000) than among female patients (2.65\% per 100,000) in the 20 to 29 age group.Interpretation: This study represents the transmission of YFV human-to-human via the bite of the infected vector. The re-emergence of YFV is a huge concern for a national public health system. Thus, laboratory and public health surveillance systems have to be strengthened to alleviate the risk of re-emerging human infections.Funding: Or{\c c}amento Geral de Estado (State General budget) 2022 was allocated to the National Institute for Health Research (INIS), through the Ministry of Health, Angola.Declaration of Interests:The authors declare no competing interests.Ethics Approval Statement: By the ministry of health policy, all patients or guardians in case of minor patients, are requested to give their consent to perform research on their samples sent to the National referral laboratory of INIS.

The objective of this article was to develop a forecasting model for dengue incidence in Campinas, southeast Brazil, considering the Box-Jenkins modeling approach. Methods: The forecasting model for dengue incidence was performed with R software using the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. We fitted a model based on the reported monthly incidence of dengue from 1998 to 2008, and we validated the model using the data collected between January and December of 2009. Results: SARIMA (2,1,2) (1,1,1)12 was the model with the best fit for data. This model indicated that the number of dengue cases in a given month can be estimated by the number of dengue cases occurring one, two and twelve months prior. The predicted values for 2009 are relatively close to the observed values. Conclusions: The results of this article indicate that SARIMA models are useful tools for monitoring dengue incidence. We also observe that the SARIMA model is capable of representing with relative precision the number of cases in a next year.},

  abstract = {Maintaining connectivity for broad-scale ecological processes like dispersal and gene flow is essential for conserving endangered species in fragmented landscapes. However, determining which habitats should be set aside to promote connectivity has been difficult because existing models cannot incorporate effects of multiple pathways linking populations. Here, we test an ecological connectivity model that overcomes this obstacle by borrowing from electrical circuit theory. The model vastly improves gene flow predictions because it simultaneously integrates all possible pathways connecting populations. When applied to data from threatened mammal and tree species, the model consistently outperformed conventional gene flow models, revealing that barriers were less important in structuring populations than previously thought. Circuit theory now provides the best-justified method to bridge landscape and genetic data, and holds much promise in ecology, evolution, and conservation planning.},

In Gaussian processes the main challenge is the definition of valid kernels (covariance functions) able to capture the relationships between different tasks. This paper presents a novel methodology to construct valid multi-task covariance functions (Mercer kernels) for Gaussian processes allowing for a combination of kernels with different forms. The method is based on Fourier analysis and is general for arbitrary stationary covariance functions. Analytical solutions for cross covariance terms between popular forms are provided including Mate{\textasciiacute}rn, squared exponential and sparse covariance functions. Experiments are conducted with both artificial and real datasets demonstrating the benefits of the approach.},

  doi = {10.17635/lancaster/thesis/1164},
  abstract = {Advanced statistical models are a key tool in developing interventions to reduce disease incidence, particularly in low resource settings. Infectious diseases often have complex infection processes and pathways, particularly zoonotic diseases which often have direct and indirect routes of infection. This makes epidemiological studies aimed at identifying and/or quantifying risk factors challenging, as they typically include complexities such as multi-level dependency structures, correlated covariates, missing data, and high noise.Often, data are only partially observed due to censoring and structurally missing information, and are often observational rather than the result of direct treatments. This thesis explores novel methods and models designed to tease out pathways and factors that contribute to risk of disease in humans for zoonotic pathogens. Chapter 2 develops a Bayesian non-parametric model to estimate the proportion of cases attributable to known sources of disease, and identify sub-types of pathogens which are unusually dangerous. This model was applied to a campylobacteriosis data set from New Zealand with results showingchicken from a single supplier was likely the source of approximately 70\% of cases in the data set, and identified 9 particularly dangerous subtypes. Chapter 3 widens the scope to consider the relative contributions of many potential risk factors for disease (causal or not). Our model considers many environmental and social risk factors for leptospirosis in complex urban environments, including rat exposure. We estimate both rat exposure and leptospirosis risk using a Bayesian non-parametric cut model which correctly accounts for uncertainty in the rat exposure predictions. The results identify groups of high risk individuals, based on socio-economic data and environmental risk factors, that could be targeted using interventions. This chapter highlighted a significant limitation in manyepidemiological studies which use inaccurate diagnostic techniques. Chapter 4 develops methodology to address this limitation by modelling within-host immune responses to pathogenic challenge. This was done by integrating a mechanistic ordinary differential equation model with a Bayesian censored noise model. Our model estimates expected changes in antibody levels after challenge with different pathogens, and indicates possible differences in immune response that may be responsible. The model is also able to estimate time of challenge at an individual level. The model is applied to a leptospirosis challenge data set in sheep, and shows significant differences in immune response to serovars Pomona and Hardjobovis. Integration of this methodology with epidemiologicalstudies (like those in Chapters 2 and 3) will allow for more accurate estimation of relative risks and enable more effective intervention strategies to be developed.},

The unit of analysis was each one of the 417 State municipalities, and the outcome variable was the average annual incidence of snakebite. Data were analyzed by multiple linear regression technique. The average annual incidence of snakebite ranged from zero to 221.96 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to the municipalities. The incidence of snakebite was positively and strongly associated with municipality characteristics: planted areas of cocoa and coffee, and the size of domestic bred chicken and bovine livestocks. It was concluded that several characteristics related to municipal agricultural profile were strongly associated with the incidence of snakebite.},

The growing need for realism in addressing complex public health questions is, however, calling for accurate models of the human contact patterns that govern the disease transmission processes. Here we present a data-driven approach to generate effective population-level contact matrices by using highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data on key socio-demographic features. We produce age-stratified contact matrices for 35 countries, including 277 sub-national administratvie regions of 8 of those~countries, covering approximately 3.5 billion people and reflecting the high degree of cultural and societal diversity of the focus countries. We use the derived contact matrices to model the spread of airborne infectious diseases and show that sub-national heterogeneities in human mixing patterns have a marked impact on epidemic indicators such as the reproduction number and overall attack rate of epidemics of the same etiology. The contact patterns derived here are made publicly available as a modeling tool to study the impact of socio-economic differences and demographic heterogeneities across populations on the epidemiology of infectious diseases.},

While most previous research has focused on empirical methods for generalizing from a large number of training examples using no domain-specific knowledge, in the past few years new methods have been developed for applying domain-specific knowledge to for-mulate valid generalizations from single training examples. The characteristic common to these methods is that their ability to generalize from a single example follows from their ability to explain why the training example is a member of the concept being learned. This paper proposes a general, domain-independent mechanism, called EBG, that unifies previous approaches to explanation-based generalization. The EBG method is illustrated in the context of several example problems, and used to contrast several existing systems for explanation-based generalization. The perspective on explanation-based generalization afforded by this general method is also used to identify open research problems in this area.},

The performance of the model is examined and compared with the performance of the method RAMPS via simulation when it is fitted to (i) point, (ii) areal, and (iii) point and areal data to predict several simulated surfaces that can appear in real settings.

The system minimizes the energy requirement of the vehicle and can work with different primary power sources like fuel cells, microturbines, zinc-air batteries, or other power supplies with a poor ability to recover energy from a regenerative braking, or with a scarce power capacity for a fast acceleration. The experimental HEV uses lead-acid batteries, an ultracapacitor (UCAP) bank, and a brushless dc motor with nominal power of 32 kW, and a peak power of 53 kW. The digital signal processor (DSP) control system measures and stores the following parameters: primary-source voltage, car speed, instantaneous currents in both terminals (primary source and UCAP), and actual voltage of the UCAP. When UCAPs were installed on the vehicle, the increase in range was around 5.3\% in city tests. However, when optimal control with NN was used, this figure increased to 8.9\%. The car used for this experiment is a Chevrolet light utility vehicle (LUV) truck, similar in shape and size to Chevrolet S-10, which was converted to an electric vehicle (EV) at the Universidad Catolica de Chile.

The aim of the present study was to propose a methodology of environmental risk analysis for defining priority municipalities for YF vaccination, using as example, the State of S{\~a}o Paulo, Brazil. The municipalities were divided into two groups (affected and unaffected by YF) and compared based on environmental parameters related to the disease's eco-epidemiology. Bivariate analysis was used to identify statistically significant associations between the variables and virus circulation. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was used to evaluate the relationship among the variables and their contribution to the dynamics of YF in Sao Paulo. The MCA generated a factor that was able to differentiate between affected and unaffected municipalities and was used to determine risk levels. This methodology can be replicated in other regions, standardized, and adapted to each context.},

In terms of logic we provide a unifying framework for Muggleton and Buntine's Inverse Resolution (IR) and Plotkin's Relative Least General Generalisation (RLGG) by rederiving RLGG in terms of IR.

The main tracks of transmission are known; however, the relative importance of each of the components and the respective environmental risk factors are unclear. We aimed to assess and specify quantitative evidence of environmental risks of leptospirosis transmission. Methods/findings: A database of pre-selected studies, with publication dates from 1970 until 2008, was provided by an expert group. The database has been updated until 2015 using a text mining algorithm. Study selection was based on stringent quality criteria. A descriptive data analysis was performed to calculate the medians of the log transformed odds ratios. From a selection of 2723 unique publications containing information on leptospirosis, 428 papers dealing with risk factors were identified. Of these, 53 fulfilled the quality criteria, allowing us to identify trends in different geo-climatic regions. Water associated exposures were, with few exceptions, associated with an increased leptospirosis risk. In resource poor countries, floods and rainfall were of particular importance, whereas recreational water activities were more relevant in developed countries. Rodents were associated with increased leptospirosis risk, but the variation among studies was high, which might be partly explained by differences in exposure definition. Livestock contact was commonly associated with increased risk; however, several studies found no association. The median odds ratios associated with dog and cat contacts were close to unity. Sanitation and behavioural risk factors were almost always strongly associated with leptospirosis, although their impact was rarely investigated in Europe or North America. Conclusion: This review confirms the complex environmental transmission pathways of leptospirosis, as previously established. Although, floods appeared to be among the most important drivers on islands and in Asia, the consistent pattern observed for exposure to rodents and behavioural and sanitation related risk factors indicate potential areas for intervention.},

The standard approach to the analysis of such responses is to transform the response into a new quantity that behaves more like a normal random variable. An alternative approach is to use an analysis procedure based on the generalized linear model (GLM), where a nonnormal error distribution and a function that links the predictor to the response may be specified. We present an introduction to the GLM, and show how such models may be fit. We present the GLM as an analog to the normal theory linear model. The usefulness of this approach is illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Summary John Snow was one of the founders of epidemiology. Already convinced of the value of pure water, he analysed the distribution of cholera cases in the 1848 epidemic in relation to the purity of the water supply in London. His hypothesis that cholera was spread by contaminated water was tested by the `Broad Street' epidemic of 1854. Snow quickly traced the water used in the houses affected by cholera to the pump in Broad Street, and persuaded the parish council to remove the handle. The epidemic subsided. The council did not really believe Snow, so the curate, Henry Whitehead, set out to repeat Snow's work, albeit at a more leisurely pace as the epidemic had subsided. He located 700 deaths within a 250-yard radius and showed that use of water from the Broad Street pump was strongly correlated with death from cholera. This surprised him as he had drunk water from the pump himself during the outbreak. Thus `geographical epidemiology' began, although it was some years before Snow's observations were generally accepted.},

This paper describes a study that used data collected through a national public health surveillance system in the United States to evaluate and compare the performances of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and a dynamic linear model (DLM) for estimating case occurrence of two notifiable diseases. The comparison uses reported cases of malaria and hepatitis A from January 1980 to June 1995 for the United States. The residuals for both predictor models show that they were adequate tools for use in epidemiological surveillance. Qualitative aspects were considered for both models to improve the comparison of their usefulness in public health. Our comparison found that the two forecasting modelling techniques (SARIMA and DLM) are comparable when long historical data are available (at least 52 reporting periods). However, the DLM approach has some advantages, such as being more easily applied to different types of time series and not requiring a new cycle of identification and modelling when new data become available.

  abstract = {Many environmental scientists are analysing spatial data by geostatistical methods and interpolating from sparse sample data by kriging to make maps. They recognize its merits in providing unbiased estimates with minimum variance. Several statistical packages now have the facilities they require, as do some geographic information systems. In the latter kriging is an option for interpolation that can be done at the press of a few buttons. Unfortunately, the ease conferred by this allows one to krige without understanding and to produce unreliable and even misleading results. Crucial for sound kriging is a plausible function for the spatial covariances or, more widely, of the variogram. The variogram must be estimated reliably and then modelled with valid mathematical functions. This requires an understanding of the assumptions in the underlying theory of random processes on which geostatistics is based. Here we guide readers through computing the sample variogram and modelling it by weighted least-squares fitting. We explain how to choose the most suitable functions by a combination of graphics and statistical diagnostics. Ordinary kriging follows straightforwardly from the model, but small changes in the model function and its parameters can affect the kriging error variances. When kriging is automated these effects remain unknown. We explain the choices to be made when kriging, i.e. whether the support is at points or over blocks, and whether the predictions are global or within moving windows.},

  abstract = {While in Northern hemisphere countries, the pandemic H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm) was introduced outside of the typical influenza season, Southern hemisphere countries experienced a single wave of transmission during their 2009 winter season. This provides a unique opportunity to compare the spread of a single virus in different countries and study the factors influencing its transmission. Here, we estimate and compare transmission characteristics of H1N1pdm for eight Southern hemisphere countries/states: Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and Victoria (Australia). Weekly incidence of cases and age-distribution of cumulative cases were extracted from public reports of countries' surveillance systems. Estimates of the reproduction numbers, R 0, empirically derived from the country-epidemics' early exponential phase, were positively associated with the proportion of children in the populations (p = 0.004). To explore the role of demography in explaining differences in transmission intensity, we then fitted a dynamic age-structured model of influenza transmission to available incidence data for each country independently, and for all the countries simultaneously. Posterior median estimates of R 0 ranged 1.2-1.8 for the country-specific fits, and 1.29-1.47 for the global fits. Corresponding estimates for overall attack-rate were in the range 20-50\%. All model fits indicated a significant decrease in susceptibility to infection with age. These results confirm the transmissibility of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus was relatively low compared with past pandemics. The pattern of age-dependent susceptibility found confirms that older populations had substantial - though partial - pre-existing immunity, presumably due to exposure to heterologous influenza strains. Our analysis indicates that between-country-differences in transmission were at least partly due to differences in population demography. {\copyright} 2011 Opatowski et al.},

Several ecological processes can result in strong spatial patterns of such risk or incidence: for example, pathogen dispersal might be highly localized, vectors or reservoirs for pathogens might be spatially restricted, or susceptible hosts might be clumped. Here, we briefly describe approaches to spatial epidemiology that are spatially implicit, such as metapopulation models of disease transmission, and then focus on research in spatial epidemiology that is spatially explicit, such as the creation of risk maps for particular geographical areas. Although the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases are the subject of intensive study, the impacts of landscape structure on epidemiological processes have so far been neglected. The few studies that demonstrate how landscape composition (types of elements) and configuration (spatial positions of those elements) influence disease risk or incidence suggest that a true integration of landscape ecology with epidemiology will be fruitful. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research, a methodology is proposed to quantify model uncertainty using measured differences between experimental data and model outcomes under a Bayesian statistical framework. The adjustment factor approach is used to propagate model uncertainty into prediction of a system response. A nonlinear vibration system is used to demonstrate the processes for implementing the adjustment factor approach. Finally, the methodology is applied on the engineering benefits of a laser peening process, and a confidence band for residual stresses is established to indicate the reliability of model prediction.},

We use stochastic epidemic simulations, genetic algorithms (GA), and random mutation hill climbing (RMHC) to find optimal vaccine distributions to minimize the number of illnesses or deaths in the population, given limited quantities of vaccine. Due to the non-linearity, complexity and stochasticity of the epidemic process, it is not possible to solve for optimal vaccine distributions mathematically. However, we use GA and RMHC to find near optimal vaccine distributions. We model an influenza pandemic that has age-specific illness attack rates similar to the Asian pandemic in 1957-1958 caused by influenza A(H2N2), as well as a distribution similar to the Hong Kong pandemic in 1968-1969 caused by influenza A(H3N2). We find the optimal vaccine distributions given that the number of doses is limited over the range of 10-90\% of the population. While GA and RMHC work well in finding optimal vaccine distributions, GA is significantly more efficient than RMHC. We show that the optimal vaccine distribution found by GA and RMHC is up to 84\% more effective than random mass vaccination in the mid range of vaccine availability. GA is generalizable to the optimization of stochastic model parameters for other infectious diseases and population structures. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The theory of intuition learning is briefly reviewed and a model of the learning process is presented. The paper then discusses and characterizes an Interactive Intuition Learning System (IILS) and its relationship to experiential learning and learning pattern. From the initial intuition decision system defined by the experience judgment, a series of learning interval-systems with various experience levels are created. Firstly, human intuitive decision making gotten by the learning approach of self-organization of intuition decision processing, and the concept mapping of selection of knowledge and experience is established by artificial intuition method based on the decision trait of human intuition. Finally, an artificial intuition method combined with self-organization method of intuition computing is proposed according to the amelioration of the intuition computing. Experiment proves that the Intuition Concept Space and the interactive mapping intuition pattern inversion (IMIPI) approach are feasible. A prototype for a intuition learning environment designed and built by the author is then discussed along with its application in the design of a crime analysis for learning electrical circuits.},

  abstract = {Venomous snakebite is a neglected tropical disease that annually leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths or long-term physical and mental ailments across the developing world. Insufficient data on spatial variation in snakebite risk, incidence, human vulnerability, and accessibility of medical treatment contribute substantially to ineffective on-ground management. There is an urgent need to collect data, fill knowledge gaps and address on-ground management problems. The use of novel, and transdisciplinary approaches that take advantage of recent advances in spatio-temporal models, `big data', high performance computing, and fine-scale spatial information can add value to snakebite management by strategically improving our understanding and mitigation capacity of snakebite. We review the background and recent advances on the topic of snakebite related geospatial analyses and suggest avenues for priority research that will have practical on-ground applications for snakebite management and mitigation. These include streamlined, targeted data collection on snake distributions, snakebites, envenomings, venom composition, health infrastructure, and antivenom accessibility along with fine-scale models of spatio-temporal variation in snakebite risk and incidence, intraspecific venom variation, and environmental change modifying human exposure. These measures could improve and `future-proof' antivenom production methods, antivenom distribution and stockpiling systems, and human-wildlife conflict management practices, while simultaneously feeding into research on venom evolution, snake taxonomy, ecology, biogeography, and conservation.},

  abstract = {Epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are known to occur in wintertime in temperate countries including the United States, but there is a limited understanding of the importance of climatic drivers in determining the seasonality of RSV. In the United States, RSV activity is highly spatially structured, with seasonal peaks beginning in Florida in November through December and ending in the upper Midwest in February-March, and prolonged disease activity in the southeastern US. Using data on both age-specific hospitalizations and laboratory reports of RSV in the US, and employing a combination of statistical and mechanistic epidemic modeling, we examined the association between environmental variables and state-specific measures of RSV seasonality. Temperature, vapor pressure, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were significantly associated with the timing of RSV activity across states in univariate exploratory analyses. The amplitude and timing of seasonality in the transmission rate was significantly correlated with seasonal fluctuations in PET, and negatively correlated with mean vapor pressure, minimum temperature, and precipitation. States with low mean vapor pressure and the largest seasonal variation in PET tended to experience biennial patterns of RSV activity, with alternating years of "early-big" and "late-small" epidemics. Our model for the transmission dynamics of RSV was able to replicate these biennial transitions at higher amplitudes of seasonality in the transmission rate. This successfully connects environmental drivers to the epidemic dynamics of RSV; however, it does not fully explain why RSV activity begins in Florida, one of the warmest states, when RSV is a winter-seasonal pathogen. Understanding and predicting the seasonality of RSV is essential in determining the optimal timing of immunoprophylaxis.},

Through combining the characters of both AHC and compartment model, we built a susceptive-infective-removal (SIR) model suited for AHC outbreaks control in schools, and then quarantine was added into the model to develop a susceptive-infective-quarantine-removal (SIQR) model. An outbreak of AHC in Changsha in 2011 was employed as a sample to assess the effect of quarantine for the prevention and control of AHC. Basic reproduction number ({$\lambda$}0) of the AHC outbreak without intervention was 6.80, thus the transmission speed of the disease became quite fast. If no intervention had been adopted, almost all the students, faculties and staff members would have been infected within 23 days, and the accumulative cases would become 738, with the total attack rate (TAR) as 99.73\%. The peak of the outbreak was at Sep. 11th and the number of new cases was 126 on that day. The efficacy would have been different if quarantine forces had been taken at different time and differently. The bigger and earlier the quarantine force had been adopted, the lower morbidity peak and the smaller TAR would have been appeared, with better efficacy of outbreak control. If the quarantine rate had been taken at the level of 90\% on the sixth day, the accumulative case would have been reduced to 132 and the TAR had become 17.84\% consequently. Quarantine program could be used as a main intervention approach to be employed for ACH outbreak at schools.}

Effective response to such outbreaks relies on timely intervention, ideally informed by all available sources of data. The collection, visualization and analysis of outbreak data are becoming increasingly complex, owing to the diversity in types of data, questions and available methods to address them. Recent advances have led to the rise of outbreak analytics, an emerging data science focused on the technological and methodological aspects of the outbreak data pipeline, from collection to analysis, modelling and reporting to inform outbreak response. In this article, we assess the current state of the field. After laying out the context of outbreak response, we critically review the most common analytics components, their inter-dependencies, data requirements and the type of information they can provide to inform operations in real time. We discuss some challenges and opportunities and conclude on the potential role of outbreak analytics for improving our understanding of, and response to outbreaks of emerging pathogens.

Throughout Indonesia, it is recorded that there are 5,590 main rivers and 600 rivers have the potential to cause flooding among others.

The floods that hit the area have resulted in disruption of public health, disrupted economic activity, and damaged urban infrastructure. The phenomenon of floods and their negative impacts in the area of the Bengawan Solo river banks, indicating a condition of the area and the public about the lack of understanding of the characteristics of the hazards, behaviours that lead to degradation of natural resources, and lack of early warning that causes unpreparedness and inability in the face of danger. The purpose of this project is to be able to create an information system that can provide an assessment of the risk management in the Bengawan Solo's flood prone areas that passed in the province of East Java, by building a web-based information system that includes information on threats, vulnerabilities, and capacities, summarized in the disaster risks analysis that integrated with Geographic Information System to provide mapping areas that have high levels of risk in accordance. Based on the factors that are already said above and calculated by Analytical Hierarchy Process, the result of this project is a map with marked regions divided into three levels of risk like High, Medium, and Low using Natural Breaks to divide it. It also, by providing the risk-level for the regions, help the system to assess how much impact and damage that will be hit the risky area and give the recommendation to government and people how to increase the preparedness so it can reduce the damage from flood.},

Hence, there has been growing interest in the development of new approaches and technologies for bridging the human--computer barrier. The ultimate aim is to bring HCI to a regime where interactions with computers will be as natural as an interaction between humans, and to this end, incorporating gestures in HCI is an important research area. Gestures have long been considered as an interaction technique that can potentially deliver more natural, creative and intuitive methods for communicating with our computers. This paper provides an analysis of comparative surveys done in this area. The use of hand gestures as a natural interface serves as a motivating force for research in gesture taxonomies, its representations and recognition techniques, software platforms and frameworks which is discussed briefly in this paper. It focuses on the three main phases of hand gesture recognition i.e. detection, tracking and recognition. Different application which employs hand gestures for efficient interaction has been discussed under core and advanced application domains. This paper also provides an analysis of existing literature related to gesture recognition systems for human computer interaction by categorizing it under different key parameters. It further discusses the advances that are needed to further improvise the present hand gesture recognition systems for future perspective that can be widely used for efficient human computer interaction. The main goal of this survey is to provide researchers in the field of gesture based HCI with a summary of progress achieved to date and to help identify areas where further research is needed.}

Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71\%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73\%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.},

  abstract = {Ripple down rules have addressed two of the major limitations of first generation Expert Systems (ES), the maintenance and knowledge acquisition (KA) bottleneck problems. This is achieved through acquiring knowledge directly from an expert, the use of an exception structure for knowledge representation and the storing of the cornerstone case associated with each rule. Just as RDR has offered a paradigm shift in the way these problems were solved, it is expected that RDR can offer a new approach to the issue of knowledge reuse. Due the poor acceptance of ES by end-users, our focus is more on reusing knowledge in different modes, such as explanation, critiquing or `what-if' within the same domain rather than the more conventional approach of reusing problem-solving methods or ontologies to solve a similar problem in a somewhat differerent domain. An evaluation of RDR for reuse showed that many modes of use were possible without any change to the knowledge or its structure but that some modes required understanding of the models represented. Since RDR does not require analysis or modeling of the domain for KA, maintenance or finding conclusions we have incorporated ideas from Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to allow concepts and the relationships between them to be identified and explored. The addition of FCA tools to RDR is described in this paper.},

  abstract = {Background The 2017--2018 yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreak in southeastern Brazil marked a reemergence of YFV in urban states that had been YFV-free for nearly a century. Unlike earlier urban YFV transmission, this epidemic was driven by forest mosquitoes. The objective of this study was to evaluate environmental drivers of this outbreak. Methodology/Principal findings Using surveillance data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health on human and non-human primate (NHP) cases of YFV, we traced the spatiotemporal progression of the outbreak. We then assessed the epidemic timing in relation to drought using a monthly Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and evaluated demographic risk factors for rural or outdoor exposure amongst YFV cases. Finally, we developed a mechanistic framework to map the relationship between drought and YFV. Both human and NHP cases were first identified in a hot, dry, rural area in northern Minas Gerais before spreading southeast into the more cool, wet urban states. Outbreaks coincided with drought in all four southeastern states of Brazil and an extreme drought in Minas Gerais. Confirmed YFV cases had an increased odds of being male (OR 2.6; 95\% CI 2.2--3.0), working age (OR: 1.8; 95\% CI: 1.5--2.1), and reporting any recent travel (OR: 2.8; 95\% CI: 2.3--3.3). Based on this data as well as mosquito and non-human primate biology, we created the ``Mono-DrY'' mechanistic framework showing how an unusual drought in this region could have amplified YFV transmission at the rural-urban interface and sparked the spread of this epidemic. Conclusions/Significance The 2017--2018 YFV epidemic in Brazil originated in hot, dry rural areas of Minas Gerais before expanding south into urban centers. An unusually severe drought in this region may have created environmental pressures that sparked the reemergence of YFV in Brazil's southeastern cities.},

An old approximate technique is the Laplace method or approximation, which dates back to PierreSimon Laplace (1774). This simple idea approximates the integrand with a second order Taylor expansion around the mode and computes the integral analytically. By developing a nested version of this classical idea, combined with modern numerical techniques for sparse matrices, we obtain the approach of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) to do approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs). LGMs represent an important model-abstraction for Bayesian inference and include a large proportion of the statistical models used today. In this review, we will discuss the reasons for the success of the INLA-approach, the R-INLA package, why it is so accurate, why the approximations are very quick to compute and why LGMs make such a useful concept for Bayesian computing.},

  abstract = {Adaptive systems---those that can change their behavior at runtime---pose new challenges for certification, and particularly for traditional, standards-based methods of certification such as DO-178B. These traditional methods are effective in conservative fields because they can establish a solid basis in experience and can incorporate the lessons learned from previous systems. They seem likely to prove less effective in fast-moving fields where innovation outstrips the pace at which experience can be incorporated into standards. Argument-based safety cases offer a plausible alternative basis for certification in these fast-moving fields. A safety case provides an explicit statement of safety claims, a body of evidence con- cerning the system, and an argument, based on the evidence, that the system satisfies its claims; standards-based methods, in contrast, specify only the evidence to be produced. Areasonable objection to safety cases is that many arguments---especially large, complex ones---can appear plausible, yet harbor flaws. There is a need for tools that can help analyze arguments. Some model-based design tools can do this, but generally operate at a far more detailed level of design than is appropriate for much of safety analysis. Some interactive theorem provers can do it, too, but they generally require notation and skills far removed from those found in aerospace and safety engineering. In this paper we argue that analysis tools based on recent advances in formal methods (SMT solvers, infinite bounded model checkers, and k-induction) can provide suitable mod- eling notations, effective analysis, and push button automation. We illustrate the approach with a simple example based on a self-checking pair. We further argue that monitors derived from a safety case provide a potentially certifi- able means for entering an adaptive mode of behavior, and that monitors generated from a formally analyzed case can be ``possibly perfect,'' which is a property that allows a novel kind of reliability analysis.

We then describe the necessity, and the challenge, of extending this to compositional certification and outline promising directions for accomplishing this.

Traditional approaches to certification require the software, its systems context, and all their associated assurance artifacts to be available for scrutiny in their final, completed forms. But modern development practices often postpone the determination of final system configuration from design time to integration time, load time, or even runtime. Adaptive systems go beyond this and modify or synthesize functions at runtime. Developments such as these require an overhaul to the basic framework for certification, so that some of its responsibilities also may be discharged at integration-, load- or runtime. We outline a suitable framework, in which the basis for certification is changed from compliance with standards to the construction of explicit goals, evidence, and arguments (generally called an ``assurance case''). We describe how runtime verification can be used within this framework, thereby allowing certification partially to be performed at runtime or, more provocatively, enabling ``runtime certification.''},

One of the most useful functions of GIS in epidemiology continues to be its utility in basic mapping. GIS may also involve more sophisticated spatial analysis of disease occurrence and contributing environmental factors. Depending on the quantity and quality of data and the methodology used in analysis, a given map may be either useful or misleading. Although visual analyses (mapped evidence) strengthened by exploratory analyses are mostly sufficient for epidemiologists, the formal testing of certain hypotheses or the estimation of relationships between measures of disease incidence and, for example, environmental covariates require quantitative modelling of disease distribution. It is a promising prospect that spatial statistics and GIS technology have slowly started to merge. However, whether GIS will be useful in the model-based approach and the prediction in, for example, epidemiology remains to be seen. The desired future development of GIS requires a switch of emphasis from data and information to knowledge.},

We demonstrate that the number of training samples and the training time for a specific robot positioning accuracy can be reduced using explanation-based fuzzy neural networks and the Q-Learning algorithm. The system uses Q-learning to find the optimal policy in conjunction with the reinforcement learning. This policy is used by a robot to reach an object that has been randomly placed in a static workspace. Background knowledge about the robot and its environment is transferred to the robot agent during the learning process using a set of previously trained neural networks. This system learns the optimal policy in order to select the best action that maximizes the cumulative reward received at each time step. This learning approach does not use either a robot or camera model, or require calibration. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of this methodology to improve the learning process and the performance of the self-learning visual servoing system.},

A national control programme was initiated in Brazil in the mid-1970s and proved successful in terms of morbidity control, as the number of cases with hepato-splenic involvement was reduced significantly. To consolidate control and move towards elimination, there is a need for reliable maps on the spatial distribution of schistosomiasis, so that interventions can target communities at highest risk. The purpose of this study was to map the distribution of Schistosoma mansoni in Brazil. We utilized readily available prevalence data from the national schistosomiasis control programme for the years 2005--2009, derived remotely sensed climatic and environmental data and obtained socioeconomic data from various sources. Data were collated into a geographical information system and Bayesian geostatistical models were developed. Model-based maps identified important risk factors related to the transmission of S. mansoni and confirmed that environmental variables are closely associated with indices of poverty. Our smoothed predictive risk map, including uncertainty, highlights priority areas for intervention, namely the northern parts of North and Southeast regions and the eastern part of Northeast region.

The superiority of the EBL{$\ast$}DI algorithm is demonstrated with experiments in three different application domains. The EBL{$\ast$}DI algorithm is developed using a novel formal framework in which traditional EBL techniques are reconstructed as the structured application of three explanation-transformation operators. We extend this basic framework by introducing two additional operators that, when combined with the first three operators, allow us to prove a completeness result: in the formal framework, every EBL algorithm is equivalent to the application of the five transformation operators according to some control strategy. The EBL{$\ast$}DI algorithm employs all five proof-transformation operators guided by five domain-independent control heuristics.},

Poisson regression model of excess mortality including both spatially correlated and unstructured random effects was fitted to the data of patients diagnosed with ovarian and breast cancer in Finland during 1955-2014 with follow up from 1960 through 2014 by using the period approach with five-year calendar time windows. We estimated standard deviations associated with variation (i) between hospital districts and (ii) between municipalities within hospital districts. Posterior estimates based on the INLA approach were compared to those based on the MCMC simulation. The estimates of the variation parameters were similar between the two approaches. Variation within hospital districts dominated in the total variation between municipalities. In 2000-2014, the proportion of the average variation within hospital districts was 68\% (95\% posterior interval: 35\%-93\%) and 82\% (60\%-98\%) out of the total variation in ovarian and breast cancer, respectively.

It is endemic in several nations, causing hundreds of thousands of annual infections and tens of thousands of deaths. In Brazil, cases in recent decades have been seen in western areas of the nation, typically in regions adjacent to the Amazon Rainforest. A major outbreak beginning in December 2016, however, saw a major increase in cases, particularly in southeastern states.

Also of interest is the ability to anticipate future fatalities by finding the proportion of cases that are fatal. Several mechanisms influence risk of Yellow Fever cases, including human activities and environmental conditions. The latter is comprised of many characteristics outside of human control, representing a component of risk that cannot be targeted for direct intervention, but only used for preparations. Using environmental conditions to predict future Yellow Fever burden typically employs the use of either mathematical or statistical models to quantify relationships between environmental predictors and disease burden. In developing such models, several assumptions are made out of necessity. One particular assumption, relating to the time units used in developing a model, is not commonly investigated for its potential impact on describing disease dynamics. In order to investigate these various topics, four studies were conducted in order to predict Yellow Fever burden using various environmental conditions, estimate fatality risk among severe Yellow Fever cases, and examine assumptions of time unit sizes when describing disease incidence probabilistically. The findings of the various studies show sensitivity when changing time unit sizes, offer an update of the estimated fatality risk among severe Yellow Fever cases, and estimate potential for Yellow Fever case burden throughout Brazil both using annual environmental trends and weekly weather patterns. Methodological contributions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Nationwide disease surveillance at a high spatial resolution is desired for many infectious diseases, including Visceral Leishmaniasis. Statistical and mathematical models using data collected from surveillance activities often use a spatial resolution and scale either constrained by data availability or chosen arbitrarily. Sensitivity of model results to the choice of spatial resolution and scale is not, however, frequently evaluated. This study aims to determine if the choice of spatial resolution and scale are likely to impact statistical and mathematical analyses. Visceral Leishmaniasis in Brazil is used as a case study. Probabilistic characteristics of disease incidence, representing a likely outcome in a model, are compared across spatial resolutions and scales. Best fitting distributions were fit to annual incidence from 2004 to 2014 by municipality and by state. Best fits were defined as the distribution family and parameterization minimizing the sum of absolute error, evaluated through a simulated annealing algorithm. Gamma and Poisson distributions provided best fits for incidence, both among individual states and nationwide. Comparisons of distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence shows that incidence by state and by municipality do not follow distributions that provide equivalent information. Few states with Gamma distributed incidence follow a distribution closely resembling that for national incidence. These results demonstrate empirically how choice of spatial resolution and scale can impact mathematical and statistical models.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Yellow fever cases are under-reported and the exact distribution of the disease is unknown. An effective vaccine is available but more information is needed about which populations within risk zones should be targeted to implement interventions. Substantial outbreaks of yellow fever in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Brazil, coupled with the global expansion of the range of its main urban vector, \emph{Aedes aegypti}, suggest that yellow fever has the propensity to spread further internationally. The aim of this study was to estimate the disease's contemporary distribution and potential for spread into new areas to help inform optimal control and prevention strategies.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We assembled 1155 geographical records of yellow fever virus infection in people from 1970 to 2016. We used a Poisson point process boosted regression tree model that explicitly incorporated environmental and biological explanatory covariates, vaccination coverage, and spatial variability in disease reporting rates to predict the relative risk of apparent yellow fever virus infection at a 5 {\texttimes} 5 km resolution across all risk zones (47 countries across the Americas and Africa). We also used the fitted model to predict the receptivity of areas outside at-risk zones to the introduction or reintroduction of yellow fever transmission. By use of previously published estimates of annual national case numbers, we used the model to map subnational variation in incidence of yellow fever across at-risk countries and to estimate the number of cases averted by vaccination worldwide.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Substantial international and subnational spatial variation exists in relative risk and incidence of yellow fever as well as varied success of vaccination in reducing incidence in several high-risk regions, including Brazil, Cameroon, and Togo. Areas with the highest predicted average annual case numbers include large parts of Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and South Sudan, where vaccination coverage in 2016 was estimated to be substantially less than the recommended threshold to prevent outbreaks. Overall, we estimated that vaccination coverage levels achieved by 2016 avert between 94 336 and 118 500 cases of yellow fever annually within risk zones, on the basis of conservative and optimistic vaccination scenarios. The areas outside at-risk regions with predicted high receptivity to yellow fever transmission (eg, parts of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand) were less extensive than the distribution of the main urban vector, \emph{A aegypti}, with low receptivity to yellow fever transmission in southern China, where \emph{A aegypti} is known to occur.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Our results provide the evidence base for targeting vaccination campaigns within risk zones, as well as emphasising their high effectiveness.

  abstract = {Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral disease, affecting humans and non-human primates (NHP), caused by the yellow fever virus (YFV). Despite the existence of a safe vaccine, YF continues to cause morbidity and mortality in thousands of people in Africa and South America. Since 2016, massive YF outbreaks have taken place in Brazil, reaching YF--free zones, causing thousands of deaths of humans and NHP. Here we reviewed the main epidemiological aspects, new clinical findings in humans, and issues regarding YFV infection in vectors and NHP in Brazil. The 2016--2019 YF epidemics have been considered the most significant outbreaks of the last 70\,years in the country, and the number of human cases was 2.8 times higher than total cases in the previous 36\,years. A new YFV lineage was associated with the recent outbreaks, with persistent circulation in Southeast Brazil until 2019. Due to the high number of infected patients, it was possible to evaluate severity and death predictors and new clinical features of YF. Haemagogus janthinomys and Haemagogus leucocelaenus were considered the primary vectors during the outbreaks, and no human case suggested the occurrence of the urban transmission cycle. YFV was detected in a variety of NHP specimens presenting viscerotropic disease, similar to that described experimentally. Further studies regarding NHP sensitivity to YFV, YF pathogenesis, and the duration of the immune response in NHP could contribute to YF surveillance, control, and future strategies for NHP conservation.},

  abstract = {Background. In response to repeated requests for assistance in evaluating the health benefit and cost implications of adjustments to national measles immunization strategies, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the Measles Strategic Planning (MSP) tool to harness routinely available data to estimate effectiveness and cost effectiveness of vaccination strategies. Method. The MSP tool estimates measles incidence and mortality through a country-specific cohort model, using a probability of infection dependent on population immunity levels. This method approximates measles transmission dynamics without requiring detailed data that would prohibit use in low- and middle-income countries. Coupled with cost data, the tool estimates incremental costs and cost effectiveness of user-defined vaccination strategies over 5-10 year planning periods. Results. The MSP tool produces valid estimates of measles incidence in settings with low to moderate vaccination coverage. Early adopters report that the tool facilitates decision making by minimizing the amount of time required to assess the impact of vaccination strategies on population immunity. Conclusions. By clearly illustrating what vaccination strategies can effectively protect against measles at the least cost to immunization programs, the MSP tool supports evidence-based decision making for effective and comprehensive measles control. {\copyright} The Author 2011.

A number of software tools exist that can be used to process and view NetCDF data. In some cases though, the existing tools cannot do the processing required and thus, we have to write code for some of the data processing operations. One such case is when we have to merge two NetCDF files. Although the core library for read-write access to NetCDF files is written in C, interfaces to the C library are available in a number of languages including Python, C\#, Perl, R and others. Python with the Numpy package is widely used in scientific computing where the Numpy package provides for fast and sophisticated handling of the arrays in Python. NetCDF being an array-oriented data format, Python/Numpy combination is a good candidate for NetCDF processing. But in terms of performance, Python is not as fast as C. So if we are looping over the NetCDF data, as is the case when we merge two files, then as the dimension size of the arrays increases, so does the computing time. And if we have to merge 1000's of such files, then we have to look for opportunities to speed up the process. The processing time can be shortened by extracting the `looping' code out to a custom C module which can then be called from the Python code. The C `looping' code can then further be parallelised using OpenMP. This gives us best of both worlds, ease of development in Python and fast execution time in C. Problem setup can also reduce processing time if the files are sorted in such a way that the adjoining files show increasing overlap in the dimensions. And if one has access to a cluster of machines, then exploiting the parallelism at a coarser level by running multiple merge processes simultaneously will expedite the process more so than just parallelizing the loop given that the number of machines available is more than the cores in a single machine.},

  abstract = {Abstract An artificial neural network (ANN) is a powerful mathematical framework used to either model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or find patterns in data. It is based on an interconnected group of artificial neurons, and it employs a connectionist approach to computation when processing information. \{ANNs\} have been successfully used for a great variety of applications, such as decision making, quantum chemistry, radar systems, face identification, gesture recognition, handwritten text recognition, medical diagnosis, financial applications, robotics, data mining, and e-spam filtering. In the speech community, neural architectures have been used since the beginning of the 1980s, and \{ANNs\} have been proven useful to accomplish several speech processing tasks, e.g., to extract linguistically motivated features, to perform speech detection, and to generate local scores to be used for different goals. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the use of \{ANNs\} for speech applications due to a major advance made in pre-training the weights in deep neural networks (DNNs). It seems that a new trend to move the speech technology forward through the use of \{NNs\} has begun, and it can therefore be instructive to review key \{ANN\} applications to automatic speech processing. In this paper, several ANN-based applications for speech processing will be presented, ranging from speech attribute extraction to phoneme estimation and/or classification. Furthermore, it will be shown that \{ANNs\} play a key role in several important speech applications, such as large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) and automatic language recognition. The goal of the paper is to summarize chief \{ANN\} approaches to speech processing using the experience gathered in the last seven years in our laboratories.},

Because of adaptation with use, an OLNN cannot be pre-certified at release time, simply based on the analysis of initial training sets. The findings and approaches presented here are based upon an analysis of the foundation principles and techniques that underpin the pilot certification process by which pilots are deemed sufficiently prepared to operate an aircraft.

The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the health sector is propitious and has been adopted by human and animal health professionals as an important tool in spatial analyses of health. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the geoprocessing and spatial analysis techniques adopted for mapping risk areas of human and animal leptospirosis. The articles were collected on scientific platforms by entering the following terms: SIG/GIS, leptospirose/leptospirosis, area de risco/risk area and distribuicao espacial/spatial distribution, and included in the study if they met the following criteria: a) publication in the period from 1998 to 2017; b) identification of risk areas and/or spatial distribution of leptospirosis as one of the research topics; and c) application of GIS in the methodology. As a result, we found 40 articles, published by 15 different countries, which adopted GIS for the spatial analysis and identification of risk areas of leptospirosis. Among these, only 45\% (18) conducted an spatial statistical analysis. Brazil and USA had the highest numbers of publications, 16 and 7 articles, respectively. From 2007, the use of GIS and spatial analysis techniques, applied to the theme of this study, have been intensified and diversified, and 93\% of the articles elected for this review were published from 2007 to 2017. The results point to a progressive interest of health professionals in applying these techniques for monitoring and conducting epidemiological analyses of leptospirosis, besides indicating a greater need for intersectoral integration between health professionals and others, in the use of spatial analysis and GIS techniques.},

Unlike most previous systems that use EBL, the PRODIGY system evaluates the costs and benefits of the control knowledge it learns. Furthermore, the system produces useful control knowledge by actively searching for ``good'' explanations---explanations that can be profitably employed to control problem solving. This paper summarizes a set of experiments measuring the effectiveness of PRODIGY's EBL method (and its components) in several different domains.},

Then embedded Baum--Welch algorithm is adopted to train character HMMs. Finally, best character string maximizing the a posteriori is located through Viterbi algorithm. Experiments are conducted on the HIT-MW database written by more than 780 writers. The results show the feasibility of such systems and reveal apparent complementary capacities between the segmentation-free systems and the segmentation-based ones.},

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) generated the global digital elevation/surface model (DEM/DSM) and orthorectified image (ORI) using the archived data of the Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS, nicknamed "Daichi"), which was operated from 2006 to 2011. PRISM consisted of three panchromatic radiometers that acquired along-track stereo images. It had a spatial resolution of 2.5 m in the nadir-looking radiometer and achieved global coverage, making it a suitable potential candidate for precise global DSM and ORI generation. In the past 10 years or so, JAXA has conducted the calibration of the system corrected standard products of PRISM in order to improve absolute accuracies as well as to validate the high-level products such as DSM and ORI. In this paper, we introduce an overview of the global DEM/DSM dataset generation project, including a summary of ALOS and PRISM, in addition to the global data archive status. It is also necessary to consider data processing strategies, since the processing capabilities of the level 1 standard product and the high-level products must be developed in terms of both hardware and software to achieve the project aims. The automatic DSM/ORI processing software and its test processing results are also described.},

I define a core group consisting of individuals with occupations that brings them in contact with many other people in a day. These occupations may include service industries, teachers, health care, and government workers, to name a few. High-risk individuals are those as typically designated for: children under 5 and adults over 50, people with weakened immune systems as well as emergency and health care personnel. Under certain conditions, shifting vaccination resources away from the high-risk group to the high-activity group will result in improved herd immunity in both the high-risk group and the population as whole. This results in more high-risk people protected even though less of them are being vaccinated, with the obvious implications that current vaccination policies may be far less then optimal. I show that the criteria for the optimal strategy can be derived from simple expressions gleaned from the expression for the basic reproductive number. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecological niche modelling, once relying on an adequate framework and environmental descriptors can be a helpful tool for such purposes. Despite the existence of a vaccine, yellow fever (YF) is still a public health issue. Brazil faced massive sylvatic YF outbreaks from the end of 2016 up to mid-2018, but cases in human and non-human primates have been recorded until the beginning of 2020. Here we used both human and monkey confirmed YF cases from two epidemic periods (2016/2017 and 2017/2018) to describe the spatial distribution of the cases and explore how biotic and abiotic factors drive their occurrence. The distribution of YF cases largely overlaps for humans and monkeys, and a contraction of the spatial extent associated with a southward displacement is observed during the second period of the epidemics. More contributive variables to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of cases were related to biotic factors (mammal richness), abiotic factors (temperature and precipitation), and some human-related variables (population density, human footprint, and human vaccination coverage). Both projections of the most favourable conditions showed similar trends with a contraction of the more at-risk areas. Once extrapolated at a large scale, the Amazon basin remains at lower risk, although surrounding forest regions and notably the North-West region, would face a higher risk. Spatial projections of infectious diseases often relied on climatic variables only; here for both models, we instead highlighted the importance of considering local biotic conditions, hosts vulnerability, social and epidemiological factors to run the spatial risk analysis correctly: all YF cases occurring later on, in 2019 and 2020, were observed in the predicted at-risk areas.},

These additions allow the model to be reasonably run on resolutions down to O(10km), essentially the resolution of the population and climate input data. Results from the model driven by ERAI reanalysis and FEWS/TRMM rainfall for various regions in Africa will be shown which are focus areas of the Healthy Futures and QWeCI project which demonstrate that the model produces a realistic spatial and temporal variability of malaria transmission},

Recent theory suggests that a generic feature of dynamical systems approaching a tipping point---early warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down (CSD)---can anticipate disease emergence and elimination. Empirical studies documenting CSD in observed disease dynamics are scarce, but such demonstration of concept is essential to the further development of model-independent outbreak detection systems. Here, we use fitted, mechanistic models of measles transmission in four cities in Niger to detect CSD through statistical EWS. We find that several EWS accurately anticipate measles re-emergence and elimination, suggesting that CSD should be detectable before disease transmission systems cross key tipping points. These findings support the idea that statistical signals based on CSD, coupled with decision-support algorithms and expert judgement, could provide the basis for early warning systems of disease outbreaks.},

We analyze how different mixing patterns can affect the disease prevalence, the cumulative number of new infections, and the final epidemic size. Our analysis indicates that the combination of residual immunity and behavioral changes during a smallpox-like disease outbreak can play a key role in halting infectious disease spread; and that realistic mixing patterns must be included in the epidemic model for the predictions to accurately reect reality.},

The next generation matrix method of calculating {$R$}0 in a compartmental model is described and illustrated. To address control strategies, type and target reproduction numbers are defined, as well as sensitivity and elasticity indices. These theoretical ideas are then applied to models that are formulated for West Nile virus in birds (a vector-borne disease), cholera in humans (a disease with two transmission pathways), anthrax in animals (a disease that can be spread by dead carcasses and spores), and Zika in humans (spread by mosquitoes and sexual contacts). Some parameter values from literature data are used to illustrate the results. Finally, references for other ways to calculate {$R$}0 are given.

  abstract = {Expansion of human activities frequently results in habitat fragmentation, a phenomenon that has been widely recognized in the last decades as one of the major threats to world's biodiversity. The transformation of a continuous forest into a fragmented area results in a hyper-dynamic landscape with unpredictable consequences to overall ecosystem health. The effect of the fragmentation process on Trypanosoma cruzi infection among small wild mammals was studied in an Atlantic Rain Forest landscape. Comparing continous forest to fragmented habitat, marsupials were less abundant than rodents in the continuous landscape. An overall decrease in small wild mammal richness was observed in the smaller fragments. An anti-T. cruzi seroprevalence of 18 \% (82/440) was deteced by immunofluorescence assay. Moreover, this seroprevalence was higher in the fragmented habitat than in the continuous forest. According to the collected data, 3 main factors seem to modulate infection by T. cruzi in small wild mammals : (i) habitat fragmentation ; (ii) biodiversity loss ; (iii) increase of marsupial abundance in mammal communities. Furthermore, an extremely mild controlled infection by T. cruzi was detected since no patent parasitaemia could be detected in fresh blood samples, and no parasites were isolated by haemoculture.},

  abstract = {Expertise consists of rapid selection and application of compiled experience. Robust reasoning, however, requires adaptation to new contingencies and intelligent modification of past experience. And novel or creative reasoning, by its real nature, necessitates general problem-solving abilities unconstrained by past behavior. This article presents a comprehensive computational model of analogical (case-based) reasoning that transitions smoothly between case replay, case adaptation, and general problem solving, exploiting and modifying past experience when available and resorting to general problem-solving methods when required. Learning occurs by accumulation of new cases, especially in situations that required extensive problem solving, and by tuning the indexing structure of the memory model to retrieve progressively more appropriate cases. The derivational replay mechanism is discussed in some detail, and extensive results of the first full implementation are presented. These results show up to a large performance improvement in a simple transportation domain for structurally similar problems, and smaller improvements when less strict similarity metrics are used for problems that share partial structure in a process-job planning domain and in an extended version of the strips robot domain.},

While neural networks are able to learn complex nonlinear functional relations between multiple inputs and outputs, there remains the important limitation that knowledge embedded in the neural network is opaque. This image of a black-box technology is a major factor influencing the acceptability of this approach because it does not improve the heuristic understanding of the domain problem. On the other hand, expert systems make use of logic rules to carry out heuristic reasoning. Knowledge used to reach a conclusion is transparent and can be displayed through HOW and WHY explanation facilities which are an integral part of well-founded expert systems. However, a critical problem with this approach is knowledge acquisition. This contribution introduces a fuzzy neural network to extract fuzzy rules automatically from numerical data. By changing fuzzy membership functions, three types of rules can be extracted, i.e. rules with and without fuzzy membership values and neuro-expert systems which overcome the problems described above.},

The difference operator and seasonal difference operator, which are bases of ARIMA and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), respectively, were introduced to remove the trend and seasonal component so that the original non-stationary time series could be transformed into a wide-sense stationary one, which could then be handled by Box-Jenkins methodology. However, such difference operators are more practical experiences than exact theories by now. In this paper, we investigate the power of the (resp. seasonal) difference operator from the perspective of spectral analysis, linear system theory and digital filtering, and point out the characteristics and limitations of (resp. seasonal) difference operator. Besides, the general method that transforms a non-stationary (the non-stationarity in the mean sense) stochastic process to be wide-sense stationary will be presented.},

An assumption of traditional machine learning methodologies is the training data and testing data are taken from the same domain, such that the input feature space and data distribution characteristics are the same. However, in some real-world machine learning scenarios, this assumption does not hold. There are cases where training data is expensive or difficult to collect. Therefore, there is a need to create high-performance learners trained with more easily obtained data from different domains. This methodology is referred to as transfer learning. This survey paper formally defines transfer learning, presents information on current solutions, and reviews applications applied to transfer learning. Lastly, there is information listed on software downloads for various transfer learning solutions and a discussion of possible future research work. The transfer learning solutions surveyed are independent of data size and can be applied to big data environments.},

West Nile virus (WNV) is a relatively new infectious disease in the United States, and has a fairly well-understood transmission cycle that is believed to be highly dependent on environmental conditions. This study takes a remote sensing and GIS approach to the study of WNV, using both landscape epidemiology and machine learning techniques. A combination of remotely sensed and in situ variables is used to predict WNV incidence with a correlation coefficient as high as 0.86. A novel method of mitigating the effect of limited case numbers is also tested and ultimately discarded. A consistent spatial pattern of model errors is identified, indicating the chosen variables are capable of predicting WNV disease risk across most of the United States, but are inadequate in the northern Great Plains region of the US. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
